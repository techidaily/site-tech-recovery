Your eBook manager may well do a few things that Calibre does not, but they are not things that I need to do. Other people may have needs different from mine. I have spent enough hours learning how to get Calibre to do what I want, and Kovid Goyal has been so good to me with technical support, that for me there is no real benefit in switching over to a new manager program. This might well be different for someone starting out from scratch to manage their eBooks, but my 4,787 book library is well managed and organized at present with Calibre, so I'll pass on your offer to change. I wish you the best of luck, and hope that your manager program turns out to be as good as you claim.

What will keep me from trying your product is that it doesn't track series in the metadata. Being able to have all titles in a series together is very useful to me and one of the things I like best about Calibre.

Books in a collection cannot be dragged to a computer,nor can they when the books are removed (not deleted) from the collection. Most grateful if you have a solution.

If your book can not bee added to the Ebook manager, maybe they are protected by DRM.   
 1\. you can try to remove the DRM and then add them to Epubor ebook manager.  
 2 or you can just upload the Epubor to pro version. it can remove the DRM automatically when you drag books to epubor library.
