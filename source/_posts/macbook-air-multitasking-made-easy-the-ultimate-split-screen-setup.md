## When Will Android 16 Be Released?

 Google updates the Android OS every year. Android 15 has a fall 2024 release date, so the next version, likely called Android 16, won't arrive until 2025.

 If we look at the[last few Android updates](https://www.lifewire.com/android-versions-4173277) , we can see that Google likes to wait for the fall to push it out. We expect this pattern to repeat next year.

## Android 16 Features

 We're a while out from this update, and Android 15 isn't yet available to the public. This means there are essentially zero Android 16 rumors.

 We expect[Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-bard-7151624) and Find My Device improvements, camera enhancements, better desktop mode, and maybe even a new AI-heavy app or two.

 Android 15 will introduce some brand-new features like[Theft Detection Lock and Private Space](https://blog.google/products/android/android-theft-protection/) . Some additional AI-powered privacy features would be welcome in Android 16.

 Lots of devices are expected to receive the Android 16 update, including those from Google, Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola, Nothing, Oppo, Xiaomi, and other manufacturers.

 Stay tuned for updates as we uncover leaks and other news over the next several months.
