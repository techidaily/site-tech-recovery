 What We Like

* Apt for companies deeply integrated with Microsoft products.

 What We Don't Like

* As an introductory lecture, it doesn't address specific business scenarios.

 Using AI as a part of a successful business strategy is the other side of today's rapid change. These quick Microsoft lectures aim to bridge the gap between AI technology and critical decision-making.

 The presentation seeks to answer the one immediate question for business leaders—what can you do to prepare your business for AI, and how can you plan and scale with it?

 What We Like

* Google Cloud partners can benefit from the actionable steps.
* Earn a badge of completion to showcase on your Google profile.

 What We Don't Like

* As a Google-focused course, it is narrow in its scope.

 Though this short course is Google-centric, the principles of ethical AI remain relevant.

 The course is organized into distinct modules, each taking you through the best practices followed by Google Cloud. You can then use those frameworks to mold your ethical AI strategy.

 If you're really interested in Google Cloud, be sure to check out[ the next Google Cloud conference](https://www.lifewire.com/google-cloud-next-7556297) .
