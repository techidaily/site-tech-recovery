## msstfmt.dll File Not Found? Here's How to Correctly Resolve the Error
 Msstdfmt.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the msstdfmt[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, msstdfmt.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

 The msstdfmt.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's operating systems, including Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, etc.

## How to Fix Msstdfmt.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Don't download msstdfmt.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore the file from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" msstdfmt.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover it with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the msstdfmt.dll error.
2. [Install the portable Aurora package](https://web.archive.org/web/20160105030019/https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=5663.0) if you're getting this error when you're trying to play that game. The msstdfmt.dll file is included in the download.  
 The[live web page for this download](https://aurora2.pentarch.org/index.php?topic=5663.0) no longer includes a valid link to the program. The above is an archive of the latest version.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some msstdfmt.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the msstdfmt.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
5. [Reinstall the application](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that uses this file. If the DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the msstdfmt.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this error.
6. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the msstdfmt.dll file. If this DLL file is provided by Microsoft,[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) should restore it.
7. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many service packs and other patches replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The msstdfmt.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
8. [Copy the msstdfmt.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-windows-2619210) from a working computer. You can then paste the file in the appropriate folder to hopefully stop the DLL error.  
 The original location for this file is_C:\\Windows\\system32\\_ on a 32-bit version of Windows, and_C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\_ for a 64-bit version. Copy and paste the file from and to the same folder that corresponds with your version of Windows.  
 See[How To Tell if You Have Windows 64-bit or 32-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) if you need help knowing which file to copy and which folder to copy it to.  
 After the file has been placed in the right folder,[register the DLL file with Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/regsvr32-what-it-is-how-to-register-dlls-2623958) :  
 For 32-bit versions:  
 `regsvr32 c:\windows\system32\msstdfmt.dll`  
 For 64-bit versions:  
 `regsvr32 c:\windows\syswow64\msstdfmt.dll`
9. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for hardware devices that might be related to msstdfmt.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file msstdfmt.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your video card.  
 This DLL file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
10. [Roll back a driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) to a previously installed version if errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
11. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's memory and hard drive are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause msstdfmt.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
12. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
13. Use a[free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair msstdfmt.dll related issues in the registry. A registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid msstdfmt.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. They're included as an option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
14. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the msstdfmt.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the msstdfmt.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
15. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any msstdfmt.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

 There are several ways msstdfmt.dll errors can show up on your computer. Here are some examples:

* **Msstdfmt.dll Not Found**
* **This application failed to start because msstdfmt.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.**
* **Cannot find \[PATH\]\\msstdfmt.dll**
* **The file msstdfmt.dll is missing.**
* **Cannot start \[APPLICATION\]. A required component is missing: msstdfmt.dll. Please install \[APPLICATION\] again.**

 These error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs or games, or when Windows starts or shuts down. We've seen this error with a flight simulator and the game_Aurora_ .

 The context of the error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem.
