##  Watch Bond Movies in Book Order 

 As much as the early Bond movies hold up just as well today as they did in the 1960s, that's not where the original James Bond character began.

 It was actually five years after the original film,_Dr. No_ , that we got our first taste of the James Bond origin story in_Casino Royale_ . The books started from the beginning, though they do meander a little throughout Bond's career along the way.

 It's not exact, but if you want to follow along with the books yourself, or stick to the story that is most accurate to author and James Bond creator Ian Fleming's original vision, watch the 007 movies in book order.

 Some Bond movies aren't from the books directly or reference short stories and traditionally non-canon elements, so this list does not include every Bond movie from all the James Bond actors. It also includes the two_Casino Royale_ movies. Pick your favorite, or enjoy both for their own merits.

## The Unofficial Chronology 

 James Bond fans and scholars have been debating the chronological order of the James Bond films for decades. So many of the stories feature younger, or older Bonds than the release order might suggest and even Ian Fleming didn't cover everything in Bond's early years in his early books.

 An unofficial chronology has emerged from these debates, however, and while it is more focused on the novels than the movies, you can look at Bond's body of work from start to near-finish through the same lens by following along.

| Movie                             | Actor          | Release Date | Streaming service |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |

| _Casino Royale_                   | Daniel Craig   | 2006         | Paramount+        |
| _Live and Let Die_                | Roger Moore    | 1973         | Rent or buy       |
