## Unlocking the Secrets: How to Make Your Content Explode on IG in Just 10 Steps
 Generally, an Instagram post with 100,000+ likes and 1,000+ comments leaps to virality. But it depends on your audience, number of followers, and a post's relative engagement compared to the averages for your account.

 Try these methods to give your content the best chance to go viral on Instagram.

## Tailor Your Message

 This obvious tip isn't just about your audience's age and location. You will have to drill down into your content on Instagram before you find the specific posts most of your followers are engaging with. Are they looking for funny memes, informative tutorials, or inspiring stories?

 Take advantage of[Instagram Insights](https://creators.instagram.com/grow/insights) , the default analytical tool available for Creator and Business accounts (but not personal ones). Also, check the demographic that[saves your posts the most](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-see-who-saved-your-instagram-posts-4770639) and the kind of things they like.

 As your Instagram presence improves, consider more powerful paid analytical tools like[Hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/) and[Iconosquare](https://www.iconosquare.com/) , which cover multiple social accounts. Others like[Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/) ,[Later](https://later.com/instagram-scheduler/analytics/) , and[Buffer](https://buffer.com/) offer robust Instagram analytics, too.

## Be Unique

[Viral posts](https://www.lifewire.com/tips-for-going-viral-3486236) are usually unique, so share content that offers a fresh take. Some options are behind-the-scenes glimpses at your job or hobby, personal stories, exclusive news, or creative angles on everyday moments. Does the post appeal to our basic human drives and emotions (positive or negative)?

 Support your posts with[creative captions](https://www.lifewire.com/best-instagram-captions-4171697) and a consistent visual aesthetic (as Instagram is a highly visual platform). Experiment with hashtags. Popular hashtags don't guarantee virality, so combine them with niche ones. Lastly, check your posts and see if they have the "surprise" factor.

 Track engagement in the first few hours. A surge in likes, comments, and shares compared to the usual is a strong indicator your post might be taking off.

## Watch the Explore Page (but Don't Copy)

 Instagram analytics and the**Explore** page give you a good idea of trending content. You can use the viral posts in your niche and take them as inspiration. What can you add (or subtract) to make them your own?

 Maybe a food reel on Instagram has gone viral. Your own reel can show the prep work that goes into the dish, along with quick tips and hacks to make cooking the dish easier and faster.

 Ensure you credit the original Instagrammer who inspired you.

## Target a Niche

 Instead of a scattershot, focusing on your strengths (finding a niche) can deliver better results. When starting, brainstorm the kind of content you would like to post and the ideal audience. Prep work will make it easier to create content themes, understand the audience, and be more relatable.

 Follow your passion when selecting a niche so you can be more enthusiastic. Identify content gaps there to stand apart from the competition. Avoid oversaturated topics and themes if you don't want your ideas to drown.

## Watch Trends

 Instagram's algorithm favors content that matches current trends. Remember how the pandemic exploded the "work from home" trend worldwide? On a smaller scale, it could be a trending local event in your city.

 Continuously monitor trending hashtags in your niche. Apps like[Hashtagify](https://hashtagify.app/) categorize popular hashtags and can also automatically generate them for your posts and reels. Use the search field on the Explore page to see what's popular in your area.

 Follow what's trending on other social media platforms, too, to help you find inspiration and cross-promote your content.

## Promote User-Generated Content

 Content from your small army of followers can boost engagement and help you go viral on Instagram. When users share content related to your area, it works as social proof. It can also create a snowball effect on others and spark viral success.

 You can use one of several[Instagram tools to boost engagement](https://www.lifewire.com/best-instagram-apps-to-boost-engagement-4584386) with your followers. But you must lay the groundwork by encouraging participation and building a community.

## Post at the Right Time

 Understanding when your audience is most active on Instagram can significantly increase engagement. The Instagram algorithm still favors fresh posts. Remember, this tactic will be unique to your needs and audience, so don't go by any generalized advice.

 Use analytics tools or study your past post performance with Instagram Insights to identify peak times. The built-in feature can give you clues for ideal posting times.

## Go Viral With Instagram's Reels and Other Features

 Start by understanding[how Instagram's algorithm works](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-ranking-explained/) . Then, use all the different Instagram storytelling mediums, such as Reels, Stories, and Live sessions. Every little step moves you towards the tipping point for viral posts.

 For instance, Reels are TikTok-style short videos ideal for short attention spans. Add trending audio, effects, and hashtags to make your Reels more discoverable. Publish them at the perfect time with custom Reel covers and captions to hook your audience's curiosity.

 Stories are a good fit for behind-the-scenes, more casual stuff. The chances of them going viral are lower, as they last only 24 hours. But they are great for experimenting with various content and boosting engagement.

[Instagram Live](https://www.lifewire.com/instagram-live-video-4129154) is an excellent way to make instant connections with your followers. You can use Stories and a countdown ticker together to tell your community when to tune in.

 Broadcast channels (only available on a Creator account) are also a good tool for reaching your followers directly and keeping them invested in your future posts. They are also discoverable by anyone on Instagram.

## Enlist Influencers to Your Cause

 Influencers set trends, and the Explore page is the quickest route to find them in your niche. While not everyone can collaborate with influencers or other brands, it can be a shortcut to bring their larger audience to your cause.

 Join Instagramâ€™s[Creator Marketplace](https://creators.instagram.com/earn-money/branded-content) to increase your visibility and more monetization opportunities. You can find and collaborate with influencers here while learning what makes their posts go viral.

 Also, look for nano-influencers (with around 10K followers) and micro-influencers (with 15k-75k followers), who often have smaller but more engaged communities behind them.

## Don't Spam

 It's really tough to go viral on Instagram. One of the best things you can do is to post regularly and on schedule. Instagram's algorithm likes consistency, and your followers will like a consistent voice at a consistent time. Posting too frequently, however, can make Instagram reduce your visibility and reach.

 Too many posts in a short time can fatigue your audience and lead to lower (and low-quality) engagement. Play the patient long game, as Instagram success isn't instant or guaranteed. Use Instagram's scheduling tools to balance the frequency of your posts and keep working on their quality.
