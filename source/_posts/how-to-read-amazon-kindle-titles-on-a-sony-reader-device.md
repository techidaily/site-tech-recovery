Is it possible to read Amazon books on SONY eReader? Of course, you can make it. As we know, Kindle books are protected by DRM and Sony's e-Readers don't support the Mobi format. In addition, Sony reader won't let you install Kindle app. In consequence, this guide will show you how to read Kindle books on Sony eReader with two methods.

### Method 1: Convert Kindle books to Sony eReader

As long as you convert Kindle Books to epub files, you can transfer the files to Sony eReader for reading. And you can follow below guide to convert Kindle books to ePub.

1Download Kindle books via an older version Kindle app

If you are using the latest Kindle app, please downgrade them to an older version Kindle App. Or you are not able to remove DRM from Kindle books. You can install [1.24 or below version Kindle for PC/Mac to your computer here](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).
