## [Customizable Notes: Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)

![Screen Shot of iPad Note-Taking App, Note Taking: Notes & NotebookNotepad plus Markdown Writer React Apps Pty Ltd](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MbKvv1tpHWkwSwZJMDdlHQCMaJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ScreenShot2018-07-09at10.39.39PM-5b441de2c9e77c00371bd2c5.png)

​

 What We Like

* Process drafts quickly with features like Link Mode.
* Incredible customization power.
* Convert to-do lists, notes, messages, and emails.

 Drafts, by Agile Tortoise, offers a fast way to take notes and lets you turn them into text messages, emails, or posts to social media. Think first, create your "draft," edit it, and send it to another app.

 This app integrates with iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch to type on the go. It does not support a stylus. Also, like other alternatives, the Pro version opens up a lot more customization power, including editing actions and themes and custom tagging.

**Price** : Free; monthly and Pro version memberships
