## A Comprehensive Walkthrough to Adjusting Posts on Instagram

Close 

###  What to Know

* Open Instagram >**Messenger** \> Chat conversation > Tap and hold on message >**Edit** \>**Send** .
* You can edit a message within 15 minutes of sending it.
* Each message can be edited up to 5 times.

 Our social interactions on apps like Instagram are filled with embarrassing missteps; a face-saving feature like the ability to edit messages instantly can rescue everything from typos to knee-jerk comments. This article shows you how to edit a sent message on Instagram.

##  Editing Instagram Messages on iOS and Android 

 Since early 2024, Instagram has allowed you to edit sent messages within a specific time. Whether you’re using the Instagram app on Android or iPhone, follow these steps to tweak your message even after hitting Send.

###  Note

 For now, this feature works only on the Instagram app for Android and iPhone. The Edit feature is still unavailable on Instagram's web or mobile web versions.

1. Select the chat conversation where you sent the message you want to edit.
2. Tap and hold the sent message in the chat to display a context menu.
3. Choose**Edit** from the list of options in the menu.

4. Edit the message content. You can correct typos, rewrite the entire message, or even add emojis.
5. Once you’re done, tap**Send** on the updated message.
6. The message will be sent with an**Edited** tag on top, which both of you can see.

##  Things to Remember About Editing Messages on Instagram 

 While editing a sent Instagram message is straightforward, note a few caveats about the feature.

* You can edit a message only within 15 minutes of sending it. After this time lapses, the Edit option will not be available in the context menu.
* Only five edits are allowed per message. After that, you can't edit the same message — unsending it might be a better option.
* Instagram won't notify the receiver when a message is edited. However, the Edited label shows the status to both the sender and receiver.
* The receiver can always read the original message before you get a chance to edit it.
* The sender cannot see an edit history for the message.

 The ability to[ toggle read receipts](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-read-receipts-on-instagram-5085244) , unsend messages, and tweak an already-sent message with Edit gives you more control over your messaging.
