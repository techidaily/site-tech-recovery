##  Things to Remember About Editing Messages on Instagram 

 While editing a sent Instagram message is straightforward, note a few caveats about the feature.

* You can edit a message only within 15 minutes of sending it. After this time lapses, the Edit option will not be available in the context menu.
* Only five edits are allowed per message. After that, you can't edit the same message — unsending it might be a better option.
* Instagram won't notify the receiver when a message is edited. However, the Edited label shows the status to both the sender and receiver.
* The receiver can always read the original message before you get a chance to edit it.
* The sender cannot see an edit history for the message.

 The ability to[ toggle read receipts](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-read-receipts-on-instagram-5085244) , unsend messages, and tweak an already-sent message with Edit gives you more control over your messaging.
