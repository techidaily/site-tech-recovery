### Blur Your Background While in a Call

 It's not too late to blur your Google Meet background if the call already started. Here's what to do:

1. Click the**three-dot** menu button at the bottom of the screen.
2. Select**Apply visual effects** .

3. There are two options. For a subtle change, select**Slightly blur your background** . If you need more cover, choose**Blur your background** .

 You can toggle between options to see which one looks the best. The messier (or more chaotic) your background is, the more blur you‚Äôll want.

### Turn on Background Blur Before Joining a Call

 You can also blur your background before you join a meeting.

1. Click the meeting link from the invite to enter the waiting room.

## Disable Background Blur in Google Meet

 To turn off background blur, whether you're on a call or waiting to join, open the visual effects menu by following either set of directions above. Then, select the blur option you're currently using to toggle it off. The background will return to normal instantly.  

## Why Blur Your Background?

 Blurring your background is useful for a few reasons. It can obscure clutter behind you for a more professional look. Hiding your backdrop can also protect your privacy and others in your household or office. Additionally, it also just looks nice and keeps the focus on your face, not on what‚Äôs going on behind you.

 However, if you have an older computer, the blur feature could slow it down as it is resource-heavy. If you find it‚Äôs interfering with the quality of the Google Meet call, you can quickly turn it off.

 A lighter-weight solution might be to use a virtual background. Google Meet has many options built-in, and you can also upload images.
