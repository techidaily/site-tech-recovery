## Sony Unveils a Glimpse of the Next-Gen PlayStation VR 2: Key Features Revealed

[Virtual reality](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-easing-high-encoding-issues-in-obs-for-2024/) is constantly growing. It's about to have another big growth spurt, as Sony has teased us with a little more information about its next-generation headset at CES 2022, which we've now learned will be called the PlayStation VR 2.

 The name isn't a huge surprise, as it's the most logical thing for Sony to name its follow-up to the original [PlayStation VR](https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-understanding-and-adhering-to-soundtracks-legal-requirements-on-instagram/). Slightly more surprising is the name of the new VR controllers, which Sony has decided to call the Sense controllers.

 Sony first announced the new VR [hardware early in 2021](https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/23/introducing-the-next-generation-of-vr-on-playstation/), but details were sparse. In a [blog post](https://blog.playstation.com/2022/01/04/playstation-vr2-and-playstation-vr2-sense-controller-the-next-generation-of-vr-gaming-on-ps5/), the company provided far more information on the new headset.

 As you would expect, the new headset will work with the [PlayStation 5 console](https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/discover-new-gadgets-with-toms-electronics-expertise/). It features 4K HDR, a 110-degree field of view, and [foveated rendering](https://techidaily.com/how-to-recover-lost-data-on-apple-iphone-13-mini-drfone-by-drfone-ios-data-recovery-ios-data-recovery/). The PlayStation VR 2 comes with a resolution of 2000Ã—2040 per eye and smooth frame rates of 90/120Hz.

 For tracking, the new headset features inside-out tracking, which tracks you and your controllers through integrated cameras embedded in the VR headset. It also comes with eye-tracking, headset feedback, [3D Audio](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/), and the new [PS VR2 Sense controller](https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/18/next-gen-vr-on-ps5-the-new-controller/) with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

 According to Sony, "Headset feedback is a new sensory feature that amplifies the sensations of in-game actions from the player." This sounds like a feature that could be a game-changer for virtual reality.

 On top of the headset, Sony also announced a new Horizon game called Horizon Call of the Mountain. This is one of Sony's flagship first-party franchises, so getting it on VR could be a huge selling point for the new headset.
