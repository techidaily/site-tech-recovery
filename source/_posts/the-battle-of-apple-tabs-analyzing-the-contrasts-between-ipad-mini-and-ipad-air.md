## The Battle of Apple Tabs: Analyzing the Contrasts Between iPad Mini & iPad Air

The iPad Air and iPad mini occupy the thin, light, and affordable section of the iPad lineup, but they're not identical. From differences in screen size and processor power, storage, and price, this article pits the[iPad mini](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-mini-pro-5186305) vs.[iPad Air](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-air-5-5200373) to examine their similarities and differences to help you understand which is best for you.

 The details in this article are based on the current models as of June 2024—the iPad Air M2 and 6th Gen. iPad mini—but the general comparison should apply to future models, too.

![iPad Mini vs. iPad Air](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eadnC0WByS3EPvW2HhRY7cHdDQ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/iPad-Mini-vs-iPad-Air-8f5c775aadc343449027a2e62d4a8e49.jpg)

## Overall Findings

 iPad mini

* Ultra-portable: Small and light.
* Slower A15 Bionic processor.
* Smaller screen.
* Two 12-megapixel cameras.
* 64GB and 256GB storage.
* Up to 10-hour battery.
* $499 - $799.

 iPad Air

* Portable: Thin and light.
* Faster, M2 processor.
* Two, larger screen options.
* Two 12-megapixel cameras.
* 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage.
* Up to 10-hour battery.
* $599 - $1449.

 The major way that the iPad mini differs from the iPad Air is size. The two models share many of the same features and specs—including camera, screen, and battery—but the iPad mini is the smallest and lightest iPad that Apple offers (it's also the second-cheapest; only the iPad costs less). That's its biggest draw: If you want a light, small iPad—and are willing to trade off a bit of processing power to get it—the mini is for you.

 The iPad Air is plenty thin and light, too, but it offers a few more advanced features, a more powerful processor, and a bigger screen.

 As we'll see, the specs of the two models are more similar than they are different.

## Screens: Same Technology, Different Size

 iPad mini

* 8.3-inch touchscreen.
* Liquid Retina Display with True Tone color.
* Apple Pencil support.

 iPad Air

* 11- or 13-inch touchscreen.
* Liquid Retina Display with True Tone color.
* Apple Pencil Pro, Apple Pencil support.

 Both the iPad mini and Air have high-quality, high-resolution[Liquid Retina Display screens](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-liquid-retina-display-4772527) that boast Apple's True Tone color technology to deliver brilliant, life-like images. The biggest difference between the models is that the mini has an 8.3-inch screen, while the Air offers 11- and 13-inch options. The Air also supports the[Apple Pencil Pro](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-pencil-3-8584088) , while the mini only supports the classic[Pencil](https://www.lifewire.com/review-apple-pencil-3887601) .

## Speed and Memory: The Air Is Ahead

 iPad mini

* Apple A15 Bionic chip.
* Neural Engine.
* Storage: 64GB, 256GB.

 iPad Air

* Apple M2 chip.
* Neural Engine and Media Engine.
* Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB.

 Processor speed and storage options is the other area in which the iPad mini and iPad Air differ the most.

 The current iPad Air line up is built around Apple's[M2 chip](https://www.lifewire.com/apples-new-next-gen-m2-silicon-chips-claim-to-more-than-double-the-power-7095781) , the same processor in the 2022 MacBook Air and MacBook Pro and the 2023 Mac mini. It's not Apple's most powerful chip (that's the[M4](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-m4-chip-8640914) ), but it was brawny enough for recent top-of-the-line Macs, so it's great for an iPad. It delivers speedy performance, great graphics, and dedicated subsystems for[AI](https://www.lifewire.com/strong-ai-vs-weak-ai-7508012) ,[machine learning](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-machine-learning-7495518) , and media.

 The iPad mini uses Apple's A15 Bionic processor, the same chip as 2021's[iPhone 13 series](https://www.lifewire.com/apple-reveals-iphone-13-iphone-13-pro-and-iphone-13-pro-max-5201266) . That's a powerful processor, but a bit older and with less performance than the M2\. It also lacks the M2's dedicated media subsystem.

 When it comes to storage, the Air has more options: the high-end storage tiers have no equivalent in the mini.

## Price: Mini Costs

 iPad mini

* With Wi-Fi: US$499 - $649.
* With Wi-Fi and 5G: $649 - $799.

 iPad Air

* 11-inch With Wi-Fi: $599 - $1099.
* 11-inch With Wi-Fi and 5G: $749 - $1249.
* 13-inch With Wi-Fi: $799 - $1299.
* 13-inch With Wi-Fi and 5G: $949 - $1449.

 Given the differences in screen size, storage, and processor, the two models have different price ranges.

 Both the mini and the Air come in Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and 5G models. The latter delivers optional cellular connectivity, which requires an additional monthly data plan.

 The lowest-cost mini costs $100 less than the lowest-cost Air.

[$469 at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91LXFP?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8655684%7Cn3a4dc7f5b9b441a7aef7650a0193b2c905%7C)

 The most expensive Air costs close to double the most expensive mini.

## Cameras: Nearly Identical

 iPad mini

* Back Camera: 12 megapixel, wide lens.
* User-Facing Camera: 12 megapixel, ultrawide lens, digital zoom up to 5x.
* Video Recording: up to 4K, slo-mo, 3x zoom.

 iPad Air

* Back Camera: 12 megapixel, wide lens.
* User-Facing Camera: 12 megapixel, ultrawide lens, digital zoom up to 5x.
* Video Recording: up to 4K, slo-mo, 3x zoom.

 The[camera systems on the mini and Air](https://www.lifewire.com/improve-the-ipads-camera-1994693) are close to identical. Both have two cameras—user- and back-facing—both taking photos and video at the same resolutions. Both have the same kinds of lenses, the same levels of zoom, and effects like slo-mo.

 The two models do have some differences, however. The mini has flash that the Air lacks, and the Air supports the[HDR](https://www.lifewire.com/hdr-file-2621550) 4 format to the mini's HDR 3\. But only real photo nerds will care much about those features. For the average person, the differences won't be noticeable.

## Size and Weight: mini Earns Its Name

 iPad mini

* 7.69 x 5.3 x 0.26 inches.
* 0.65 pounds.

 iPad Air

* 11-inch size: 9.74 x 7.02 x 0.24 inches.
* 11-inch weight: 1.02 pounds.
* 13-inch size: 11.04 x 8.46 x 0.24 inches.
* 13-inch weight: 1.36 pounds.

 Given that the primary way the two models differ is size, it's no surprise that the mini is physically smaller and lighter than the Air.

 The mini weighs just over half a pound and is small enough to fit into a large purse or small bag. The two options for the Air aren't heavy compared to other devices—the 13-inch version only weighs 1.36 pounds—but they weigh more than the mini.

 As the name suggests, the mini is tiny: at just 7.69 inches, it's only a little taller than the smallest Air is wide.

## Other Features: The Same in Most Ways

 iPad mini

* Battery: Up to 10 hours.
* Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Optional 5G.
* 4 color options.
* Touch ID.
* External keyboards only.

 iPad Air

* Battery: Up to 10 hours.
* Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Optional 5G.
* 4 color options.
* Touch ID.
* External keyboards and Magic Keyboard case.

 In other areas, the mini and Air are very similar. They both have similar battery life,[Touch ID](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-touch-id-4586807) authentication, support for the Apple services ecosystem (iCloud, FaceTime, iMessage, Apple Pay, etc.), and[USB-C](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490) ports.

 The few areas of difference include that the Air supports Apple's[Magic Keyboard case](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-magic-keyboard-case-7963558) , which integrates a keyboard and mouse to make the Air more like a laptop; the mini only supports external keyboards. They also have different color options, though both offer four color choices. The difference is that the mini comes in pink, while the Air is available in blue.

## Final Verdict: Size Makes the Difference

 While both iPads are fairly similar, the major reason to buy a mini is if you want the smallest, lightest iPad available. If that's the primary driver of your purchase, you can't do better.

 But if you want to balance size and weight with performance and longevity, the Air is likely a better choice. The Air delivers faster performance and, because it's built using newer technologies, it will serve you well for longer.
