## Discover the Improved Qi2 Charge Capability of iPhone 12: No Dependence on MagSafe for Fast Charging!

![iPhone 12 owners will now be able to benefit from 15W Qi2 fast wireless charging using chargers such as the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/b3c972f50687a3f50fb8e828f3a7d28c0912b5ef/2024/03/28/f40c0057-1b9e-4db6-8ece-ffbca62c31a3/untitled-1.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

iPhone 12 owners now can benefit from 15W Qi2 fast wireless charging using chargers such as the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station.

Among the many new features -- and bugs, most of which were [fixed in the iOS 17.4.1 update](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-17-4-1-and-ipados-17-4-1-more-mysterious-iphone-and-ipad-updates/) \-- introduced with iOS 17.4, iPhone 12 users discovered support for 15W wireless fast charging -- for those unwilling to invest in Apple's [MagSafe compatible chargers](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-magsafe-battery/).

**Also:** [**Is this 6-in-1 keychain charging cable a gimmick or pure genius? I tested it and found out**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-this-6-in-1-keychain-charging-cable-a-gimmick-or-pure-genius-i-tested-it-and-found-out/)

Qi2 is an updated version of the Qi wireless charging standard, developed by the [Wireless Power Consortium](https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/), of which Apple is a big supporter. The Qi2 standard brings improved power transfer capabilities, faster charging speeds, and greater energy efficiency. Qi2 also offers better foreign object detection and enhanced safety features.

If this reminds you of Apple's MagSafe wireless charging technology -- you'd be correct!

According to the Wireless Power Consortium, Apple "provided the basis for the new Qi2 standard building on its MagSafe technology," and makes use of magnets to provide a secure way to better attach and align the smartphone with the charger, a technology that is called Magnetic Power Profile.

What does this mean for iPhone users? They now can get the same 15W charging speeds offered by official MagSafe chargers from third-party Qi2-certified chargers. 

Qi2 support was built into the iPhone 15 and subsequently rolled out to iPhone 14 and 13 users with the iOS 17.2 release.

Now it's the iPhone 12 owners' turn to get this technology.
