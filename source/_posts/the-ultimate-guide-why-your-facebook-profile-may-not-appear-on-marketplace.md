## The Ultimate Guide: Why Your Facebook Profile May Not Appear on Marketplace

Close 

 You can't buy or sell on[ Facebook Marketplace](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-marketplace-4589107) if the app icon is missing. Here's what's most likely happening and some steps you can take to get the icon back.

##  Reasons Why the Facebook Marketplace Icon Is Missing 

 Here's a list of possible reasons your Facebook doesn't have the Marketplace option:

* **There's an app bug** . An unresolved software bug could be to blame.
* **Youâ€™re not an adult** . Facebook Marketplace is only available to users who are considered an adult in their respective countries.
* **You're in an unsupported country** . Marketplace is available in most regions, but not everywhere.
* **The wrong profile is selected** . Access to Facebook Marketplace is only available in your main profile, which is the one you made when you first got on Facebook.
* **Your account is too new** . Facebook Marketplace has been known to not appear at all to new Facebook users. This is likely done to prevent scammers from creating new accounts and selling fake products soon after having previous accounts banned from the platform.
* **Your access has been revoked** . This can happen if you used Marketplace in a way that violated Facebook's Terms of Service and other policies.

##  How to Get Marketplace on Facebook 

 Follow these tips to see if you can get the Marketplace icon back in your Facebook account:

1. [ Visit Facebook Marketplace directly](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) . Using Marketplace in a web browser confirms that you have access to the service even if the app isn't working for you.
2. [ Log out of Facebook](https://www.lifewire.com/log-out-of-facebook-5295737) and then log back in again. The Marketplace icon might be missing because of a temporary glitch.
3. Reinstall the Facebook app. If you're trying to use Marketplace from your phone or tablet, deleting the app on Android \[[ Delete Android Apps](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-apps-on-android-phone-5271421) \] or iOS \[[ Delete iPhone Apps](https://www.lifewire.com/delete-apps-from-iphone-2000648) \] will allow you to install a fresh version, hopefully without the bug that caused you to lose access to Marketplace.
4. Open Marketplace from the menu. The Facebook Marketplace icon at the top of the app is how most people access it, but it's also available through the menu. If you don't see the Marketplace icon, tap your profile picture and then choose**Marketplace** .  
 Still can't find the icon? It might just be hidden. Tap**See more** through the menu.
5. Select a link to a Marketplace listing. You can have anyone share the link with you. Tap it from your phone to launch Facebook and, hopefully, restore access to Marketplace. You might need to interact with the listing, too, like message the seller.
6. Switch to your main profile. Other profiles do not support Marketplace. Tap the**menu** and then select the**profile image** to see your options.

7. Give the Facebook app access to your location, and then log out and back in. If you traveled recently, the app might think you're in an unsupported country. Find Facebook in your device's Settings app provide location permissions.
8. [ Fill out the Marketplace Item Appeal form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/953354718105045) . This is the only way to restore access to Facebook Marketplace if an item you were trying to sell wasn't approved because it didn't meet Facebook's policies.
9. Use your Facebook account. If this is a new account,[ add some friends](https://www.lifewire.com/send-a-facebook-friend-request-5225904) and interact with them to show Facebook that your account is alive and real.
10. Change your home country. This is a stretch, but it might work. To do this, select**About** \>**Places lived** from your profile page, and then change your location to a region located in a[ country where Facebook Marketplace is available](https://www.facebook.com/help/1968285150185577) .

##  Is There a Facebook Marketplace App? 

 While there are separate apps for Facebook and[ Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) , Marketplace works in two places only: the Facebook mobile app and the Facebook website. Facebook does not make an app specifically for buying and selling on Marketplace.
