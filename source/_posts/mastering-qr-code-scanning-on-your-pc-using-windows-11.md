 QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes that allow you to share website links, contact details, and other information. You typically access them with a smartphone. However, there may be situations when you don't have your smartphone or when you're looking at a QR code on your desktop.

 Fortunately, there are a couple of ways to scan QR codes using your Windows PC.

##  1\. Scan QR Codes Using the Camera App

 The Windows Camera app is typically used to capture videos and [take photos on your Windows PC](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/what-everyone-needs-to-know-about-asmr-videos-for-2024/). However, it can also scan QR codes. To use this feature, press the Windows key to access the Start menu. In the search bar, type "Camera" and open the app.

 Within the Camera app, click the gear icon in the top-left corner.

##  2\. Scan QR Codes Using Google Lens

 If you come across a QR code while browsing the internet, you can use the built-in [Google Lens](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-workable-fixes-to-the-sim-not-provisioned-mm2-error-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) feature in Google Chrome to scan it. Before proceeding, [update Google Chrome](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/best-tiktok-video-editing-tips/).

 On Google Chrome, [right-click](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-recording-fun-6-techniques-to-document-minecraft-for-2024/) on the QR code you want to scan and select "Search images with Google."

 A Google Lens sidebar appears, displaying all the information related to the QR code. For example, if the QR code contains a URL, you will see the URL displayed under the QR code. You can directly visit the URL by clicking the "Website" button, or copy the URL by clicking the "Copy URL" button.
