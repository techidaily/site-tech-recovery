##  1\. Scan QR Codes Using the Camera App

 The Windows Camera app is typically used to capture videos and [take photos on your Windows PC](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/what-everyone-needs-to-know-about-asmr-videos-for-2024/). However, it can also scan QR codes. To use this feature, press the Windows key to access the Start menu. In the search bar, type "Camera" and open the app.

 Within the Camera app, click the gear icon in the top-left corner.

##  2\. Scan QR Codes Using Google Lens

 If you come across a QR code while browsing the internet, you can use the built-in [Google Lens](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-workable-fixes-to-the-sim-not-provisioned-mm2-error-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) feature in Google Chrome to scan it.

 On Google Chrome, [right-click](https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-art-of-recording-fun-6-techniques-to-document-minecraft-for-2024/) on the QR code you want to scan and select "Search images with Google."
