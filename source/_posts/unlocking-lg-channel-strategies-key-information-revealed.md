## Unlocking LG Channel Strategies: Key Information Revealed
 LG uses webOS as its[smart TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-4140172) operating system, which provides efficient and simple operation of the TV, network, and internet streaming features, including access to an abundant list of streaming channels, and full web browsing similar to a PC.

## How to Activate LG Channels

 If the LG Channels app icon isn't already showing your LG TV's menu bar, or the icon isn't active, here is how to activate it.

1. Press**Home** on your TV Remote.  
![LG TV Remote – Home Button Highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RGBzUhsj3l4tPJAjEmtPsq6KemI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_how-to-add-apps-to-a-smart-tv-alt-e82246a45bb14ed5b5293dc54049e557.jpg)  
 Depending on the model of your LG TV, the remote control may look different than the one shown, with the buttons arranged differently. However, the appearance of the home button and other button icons is the same.
2. On the TV's home screen, select**Settings.**

 If your remote control has a**Settings** button, you can click that instead of having to hit the home button first.
3. After selecting the Settings icon on your remote or home page, the Settings Menu will display on either the left or right side of the TV screen. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings menu and select**All Settings** .

## LG Channels Content Navigation

 Once activated, you can access LG Channels directly from the icon located on the main menu bar that runs along the bottom of the TV screen.

 When you click on the LG Channels icon, it takes you to a full-page channel navigation menu.

 As you scroll through the menu, a brief description of each channel you highlight will display in the top portion of the screen. You will also notice that each "channel" also has an assigned number, which you can also use to access the channel if you don't want to scroll.

 You can tag your favorite channels with a "star" so that they are easier to find later, as well.

 In all cases, when you find what you want, select it to watch.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## LG Channels Listing Combined with Antenna TV Listings

 If you receive over-the-air TV broadcasts via antenna and have also activated LG Channels, you can access both via the**Live TV** icon on the LG TV menu bar.

 Upon selecting the Live TV icon, you will have access to a combined list of over-the-air (OTA) and LG channels. The LG channel offerings are mixed right in with a TV's OTA channel listings, so you don't have to choose one or the other. You can browse everything at once.

 Unlike cable/satellite and streaming services, over-the-air TV viewers don't have to leave the main channel selection menu to access the new internet streaming channels that LG Channels offers.

 For OTA TV viewers, LG Channels provides more seamless content access and navigation, making finding that favorite show or niche content more accessible and faster.

 OTA TV channels start with a number or letter, whereas LG Channels always begin with the letters "IP."

## LG Channels By Other Names

 Xumo has also expanded the LG Channels concept to other TV brands, including:

* **Hisense/Sharp** : 60 channels are available through the virtual input selection feature.
* **Magnavox, Sanyo, and Philips Roku TVs and Roku Media Streamers** : The Xumo Play App can be added on[Roku](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) media streamers and Roku TVs via the[Roku Channel Store](https://www.lifewire.com/add-channels-to-roku-4164594) .
* **Samsung** : The Xumo Play app is available via the[Samsung App Store](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-samsung-apps-1847395) .
* **Vizio** : Xumo is available through Vizio TVs featuring Internet Apps Plus. Vizio also offers an additional alternative in partnership with Pluto TV that it refers to as WatchFree.

## The Bottom Line

 LG's partnership with Xumo is part of a continuing trend that blurs the steps usually needed to access broadcast, cable, satellite, and internet streaming content.

 Instead of the consumer having to figure out which menu holds a specific content provider or app, it can all be in one integrated list similar to a channel guide you might find for cable or satellite TV.

 Where your programming comes from isn't the main concern: your TV should be able to access and deliver it to you without you having to find it.
