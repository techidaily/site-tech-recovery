## Discover the Ultimate List: 2024'S Finest No-Cost Sports Streaming Services

Close 

 Most cable and satellite television providers offer access to live sports streaming. Cord-cutting services like[ Fubo](https://www.lifewire.com/fubotv-4159948) and[ Sling TV](https://www.lifewire.com/sling-tv-4154536) also feature many live sports, including college football. Still, websites that stream live sports for free and don't violate copyright law are a little harder to come by. We've scoured the internet to rustle up fairly decent sites. Some include intrusive pop-ups but if you can live with that, these might work for you.

## [ ESPN](http://www.espn.com/watch) 

![ESPN offers some free sports live streams, but many games are locked behind a paywall.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YaVorSkJP8Qua92c3R2bn0GnpG4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/WatchESPN-a6139c0795b3467da26090987d336746-02b8e3bd5c544e80b13cee1fa83a8e24.jpg) 

* **The site** :[ Watch ESPN](http://www.espn.com/watch)
* **The sports you can watch** : Football, basketball, baseball, college sports, hockey, golf, tennis, MMA, NASCAR, esports,[ UFC Fight Nights](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-watch-ufc-live-stream-espn-4587216) , and more.
* **Notes** : Few streams on Watch ESPN are completely free. Most require a valid login from a qualifying cable or satellite subscription or a subscription to ESPN+.

 ESPN is one of the biggest names in cable sports, and the official Watch ESPN website features many live-streaming videos. On ESPN's official site, you'll find many major sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and college.

 What you won't find on Watch ESPN, however, is every game of every sport. ESPN streams only the games to which it has broadcast rights. Some premium games on Watch ESPN require your TV provider login credentials, while others require an[ ESPN+ subscription](https://www.lifewire.com/espn-streaming-4686382) starting at $10.99 per month.

 Watch ESPN also has a variety of content you can watch without logging in or paying for an additional subscription, including news, interviews, and replays.

## [ Facebook Video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/) 

![MLB live videos on Facebook Video](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GlweBdcLDO8xCh7pwqLlTj7qyqA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mlb-facebook-live-1396e58eb0534f05bacc843de811356e.png) 

* **The site** :[ Facebook Video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/)
* **Available sports** : Soccer, cricket, women's basketball, surfing, and a range of unofficial streams covering virtually every sport.
* **Notes** : Facebook Video has a limited number of official sports streams, but Facebook users use the service to stream live sports.

 Facebook Video (formerly Facebook Watch) is Facebook's attempt to muscle in on the video streaming market. The social media giant has obtained the rights to stream various sports. In addition to official Facebook Video sports streams, Facebook users can use the service to live stream sports worldwide.

 Here's how you can find a huge variety of live sports streams on Facebook Video:

1. Navigate to Facebook Video and log in to your Facebook account.

![Facebook Watch page with URL highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/epfDLMhavL8yoEixBtVL0Int-j4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_best-free-sports-streaming-sites-4169519-5bd0c81b46e0fb005172173b.jpg) 

 2\. Select**Search videos** , type**sports** , and press**Return** or**Enter** on the keyboard.  

![Click Search videos, type sports, and press Return or Enter on your keyboard.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Qe1f_0pGd7eyV0RSS2NFbRWP3Gw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/searchsportsannotated-e547847954cb411aaa3970826cd508f1.jpg) 

 3\. Toggle on**Live** . You'll see any current sports live streams.  

![Toggle on Live to find live sports streams](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/CT6Q5cub1Lj8OtniorpyroLBH_0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/ToggleonLiveannotated-fdd985ee32fc4bff9423105ebba49f29.jpg) 

 These streams are provided by Facebook users, so you may find low-quality and misleading streams. Search for a team name if you're looking for a specific game.  

 MLB sometimes streams select games via its[ MLB Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/mlb/) , so check back frequently to see what's available. You can also catch select MLB live streams via the[ MLB YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/mlb) .

* **The site** :[ SportSurge](https://sportsurge.to)
* **The sports you can watch** : Soccer, baseball, basketball, hockey, Formula 1, MMA, football, boxing, CFB, and WWE.
* **Notes** : Links don't show up until it's about an hour before the game starts.

 This is one of the easier sites to use for free sports streaming because you're not bombarded with ads everywhere you look. It's also easy to use; select a sport, find the teams you're interested in watching, and then monitor the start time to know when the stream will be available.

 The home page lists all the games streaming soon, so it's easy to see what's coming up.

* **The site** :[ BuffStreams](https://buffstreams.is/)
* **The sports you can watch** : Football, basketball, hockey, baseball, soccer, tennis, boxing, UFC/MMA, and others.
* **Notes** : This site includes several ads.

 This sports streaming site is very similar to the others on this list. Along the top of the website are links to the various games you can stream, including NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, CFB, NCAAM, and more. You'll see exactly when the game is streaming and you're given a link that points straight to the video.

 However, be aware of the website ads. An ad blocker is enough to stop them.

* **The site** :[ Stream2Watch](https://vpn.stream2watch.com/)
* **The sports you can watch** : Football, baseball, soccer, tennis, volleyball, baseball, rugby, and others.
* **Notes** : This site features intrusive pop-ups.

 Stream2Watch is a live sports streaming site that gathers streams from other sites. It features baseball, soccer, basketball, volleyball, and other sports streams. It's a reasonably comprehensive site, and there's a good chance you'll find a good game or match.

 Like many sites that embed streams from external sources, you may run into intrusive and misleading pop-up ads on Stream2Watch.[ Running a good ad blocker](https://www.lifewire.com/stop-pop-ups-2487505) helps keep you safe.

 Even with an ad blocker, you may still see ads overlaid on some videos. The best solution is to close each ad and immediately select**Back** on the browser if you're sent to another page.
