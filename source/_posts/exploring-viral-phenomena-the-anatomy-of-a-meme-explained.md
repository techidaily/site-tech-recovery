## Exploring Viral Phenomena: The Anatomy of a Meme Explained
 A meme is a virally transmitted image embellished with text, usually sharing pointed commentary on cultural symbols, social ideas, or current events. A meme is typically a photo or video, although sometimes it can be a block of text. When a meme resonates with many people, it's spread via social platforms, texting, and email. The more a meme is spread, the greater the cultural influence it has.

 Here's a deeper look into what exactly a meme is, the different types of memes, and some meme examples.

 Some a meme sticks around a while because it represents something timeless that continually rings true for people, such as parenthood. Other memes are specific to a specific event or idea.

## The Origins of the Term 'Meme'

![Richard Dawkins meme](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kMFYdC6ycSfMsCQLEHL0qyBW9XE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dawkinsmeme-09a60a478f2849178939f9bfe701a7dd.jpg)

 Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the word "meme" (rhymes with "team") in his bestselling 1976 book_The Selfish Gene_ . While he had no idea of its future internet-related context, he used the word meme to describe an idea, behavior, or style that rapidly spreads from person to person in a culture. In his book, he likened a meme's spread to that of a virus. The word meme came from the Greek word mimeme, which means imitated thing.

 Decades later, Dawkins supported the appropriation of the word meme into the digital world. He said that the new meaning isn't that far from his original explanation.

 Memes used to be the domain of 20-somethings. However, internet users of all ages and all levels of digital savviness have adopted memes to express their feelings.

## What Makes a Meme

 Memes are a worldwide social phenomenon. The more a meme resonates with people, the more they'll share it and the farther it will spread. Memes are usually funny, but often that humor is injected with wry political or social commentary.

 Sometimes memes exist for shock value or to teach a life lesson. Other times a single photo or short video will generate hundreds of hilarious interpretations. Sometimes a meme will be appreciated by only a select group of people, and other times a meme will have near-universal appeal.

 Here's a look at some popular meme categories and examples to give you a better idea of the breadth and scope of these viral statements.

 A meme can be a still photograph or an animated GIF, as long as the content appeals to others in a shareable format.

![Goal for 2020 Meme](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wDqdLply-lXPcoY99w2_-a18D3k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Goalfor2020FunnyMeme-04eadff55a17489a85453238481fe36e.jpg)

 Popular memes are often funny, ranging from silly humor to niche humor to more pointed political humor. Kids, parenting, pets, and everyday life offer endless meme material.

 Often one funny image spurs a host of memes, as with this determined-looking toddler clenching his hand into a fist. The above meme mimics our determination on New Year's Eve to finally make positive changes.

 The same image represents our feelings of satisfaction and winning when we receive an unexpected windfall.

 Sometimes memes offer simple, funny humor most people can enjoy, such as this Pavlov joke:
