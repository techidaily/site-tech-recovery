## How to Fix Dbghelp.dll Not Found or Missing Errors

 Try these steps in order until the problem is resolved:

 Do not download dbghelp.dll from a DLL download website. There are several[reasons you shouldn't download DLLs from sites like that](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore the deleted file from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) if you suspect you've accidentally deleted it.  
 If you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, try using[data recovery software](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) to restore the file.  
![Recycle bin on the Windows 10 desktop](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/yBxQPWRmY21EcADvN-fhyIUh9AE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_how-to-fix-dbghelp-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623296-6d95d9a873f245729280b49cf1051cef.jpg)  
 Complete this step only if you're sure you deleted it yourself and that it was working fine when you did so. If your antivirus program removed it, it's best to keep it deleted.  
 You may need to[start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that uses the dbghelp.dll file. If the error occurs when using a particular program, reinstalling the software should replace the file.  
 If you're a software developer, you can get the latest version of dbghelp.dll from[Microsoft's Debug Help Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/debug-help-library) .
3. [Use the SFC /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the dbghelp.dll file.[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) should restore this DLL file since it's provided by Microsoft.  
![The sfc.scanow command in the Windows command terminal](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/r9WhO64BfeLByJeLKjlbNr4GvYM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_how-to-fix-dbghelp-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623296-ab46cf88cf0b4143bd40e064b057ceab.jpg)
4. [Check for and install Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other patches obtained through Windows Update will update the DLL files on your computer. The dbghelp.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
5. [Scan your computer for malware](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) to see if the error is due to a virus, since some hostile programs masquerade as DLL files.
6. [Use System Restore to restore your Windows PC](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) to an earlier state, hopefully to one where the dbghelp.dll file wasn't causing issues.[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) will undo recent changes to important system files.  
![System Restore on the Windows System Properties menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TEQQ8TGlPe9ASuLYcsBt3Gw_QQY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/006_how-to-fix-dbghelp-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623296-6f459328bcd1469fa7373eeed97f5e14.jpg)
7. [Update drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to dbghelp.dll. For example, if you see the "dbghelp.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .
8. [Roll back the device drivers to an older version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if the errors began after updating a particular hardware device,  
![Roll Back Driver option on the Windows hardware properties menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SY7qhpTg5UY1gI9EtpTnFDu9-zw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/008_how-to-fix-dbghelp-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623296-f0e6b77b334947d5871159663950236c.jpg)
9. Perform a[Windows Startup Repair](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) or repair installation to restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
10. [Use a registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair dbghelp.dll related issues in the registry. This could remove invalid dbghelp.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.
11. As a last resort, a[clean install of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of the[operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) .  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install.
12. Some[hardware problems can cause dbghelp.dll errors](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) . Use a[free memory testing tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) or a[hard drive testing program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) to see if the problem is related to the system[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) or other technical issues.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests, replace the memory or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible. If you're not interested in fixing this problem yourself, you can take your PC to a professional [computer repair service](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-get-my-computer-fixed-2625167) .
