 Attaching the headset, and sizing it appropriately for you, is really easy through a knob on the back. The PSVR 2 headset supports IPD (interpupillary distance) adjustment so you can fine-tune it to your face specifically. But what makes this really helpful is you don't need to know your IPD to get the headset set up.

![Sony PS VR2 headset and controllers](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YQOZPsDJRvkR6H16-bJbeNPwiEo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/sony-psvr2-headset-controllers-260b6a7a01394b4eb22225694cfa4632.jpg)

 Instead, you're put through a calibration that make sure your eyes are situated properly. It works by showing you two circles on an animated face. Just adjust the headset's fit and IPD so your eyes (the circles) look normal on the cartoon's face.

 Official footage of the full system is available via early hands-on testers. For example,[ The Verge was able to take a look at the PSVR 2 in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXz2mVD6yAw) , where we see how the headset and controllers are put on, a review of some of the specs, and a few game demos.
