### How to Flush DNS on Mac OS X

 The Mac OS X flush DNS command is different than the one used in modern versions of the operating system. Open Terminal and then enter the command that corresponds with your version:

* **El Capitan** : sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
* **Yosemite** : sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches
* **Lion, Mountain Lion, and Mavericks** : sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
* **Snow Leopard** : sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
* **Leopard** : sudo lookupd -flushcache
* **Tiger** : lookupd -flushcache

## What Does Flushing DNS Do?

 Each time you access a website in your web browser, the URL you enter is sent to a[DNS server](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dns-server-2625854) for translation into an[IP address](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ip-address-2625920) . This information is stored in a cache on your Mac for easy retrieval in the future, hence the term_DNS cache_ .

 When you try to access a website you’ve been to recently, your Mac uses its DNS cache instead of checking with an actual DNS server. The web browser doesn’t have to go through the extra step of communicating with a remote DNS server, which results in less time between entering a website address and the website loading.

 If the local DNS cache is corrupt or outdated, it’s kind of like trying to use an old phone book that's been vandalized. Your web browser checks the cache to find an IP address for the website you’re trying to visit, and it finds either the wrong address or an unusable one. This can slow the process down or prevent websites or specific web page elements, like videos, from loading.

 When you flush your DNS cache, you instruct your Mac to delete its local DNS records. This in turn forces your web browser to check with a DNS server for fresh information. You should always flush your DNS cache after[changing the DNS servers on your Mac](https://www.lifewire.com/network-preference-pane-change-macs-dns-settings-2260394) . It can also be helpful if you’re having connectivity problems.  

 FAQ

* How do I check the DNS cache on a Mac?  
 Open the built-in Console log-viewer app on your Mac and type**any:mdnsresponder** into the search bar. Then, launch Terminal, type in**sudo killall –INFO mDNSResponder** , and press**Enter** or**Return** . Back in the Console app, you can view a list of cached DNS records.
* How do I clear the DNS cache on Windows 10?  
 To[clear the DNS cache on Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/flush-and-clear-windows-dns-cache-5095298) , open the Run dialog box, type in**ipconfig /flushdns** , and click**OK** . You can also use the same command in the Windows command prompt if you want more information on the process.
* What is DNS cache poisoning?  
 DNS cache poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, is when someone deliberately enters false or incorrect information into a DNS cache. After the false information is input, future DNS queries will return incorrect responses and direct users to the wrong websites.
