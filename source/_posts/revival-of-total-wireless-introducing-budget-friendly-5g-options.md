## Revival of Total Wireless: Introducing Budget-Friendly 5G Options

[Total Wireless](https://totalwireless.sjv.io/c/156932/2091082/15774?subId1=htgnew5gplans) has been a popular pre-paid mobile carrier in the United States for years, and back in 2022, it received an overhaul with new branding. Now, Verizon is returning to the old name and updating its plans.

 Verizon purchased Total Wireless in 2021 (along with TracFone’s other brands, like Straight Talk), and [renamed it to “Total by Verizon”](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/podcasts-vs-youtube-which-should-you-choose-in-2024/) the following year. It seems that rebranding didn’t go well, so now Verizon has changed the name back to Total Wireless. There’s also a new logo and new color scheme to help differentiate it from all of the company’s other sub-brands: Straight Talk, Visible, Tracfone, Simple Mobile, SafeLink, Walmart Family Mobile, and Verizon Prepaid.

 Total Wireless now has a “Total 5G Unlimited” plan starting at $50/month for one line with Auto Pay, a “Total 5G+ Unlimited” plan for $60/month with AutoPay, and a “Base 5G Unlimited” for $40/month with AutoPay. As with most mobile carriers, the plans generally become cheaper per-line as you add more lines. For example, three people on the Total 5G Unlimited plan is $36.67 per line per month, or $110.01/month. There are also various data-only plans for tablets, PCs, hotspots, or other similar devices.

 Total Wireless is also promising a five-year price lock guarantee for new customers, so your plan will stay at current prices. However, mobile networks often break those promises—Verizon’s competitor T-Mobile [started raising prices on legacy plans](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-targeted-approach-carving-out-your-space-on-youtube/) earlier this year, after explicitly promising the prices would never change. There’s enough wiggle room here for Verizon to pull a similar move down the road, as the price lock does not apply to “any promotions, add-ons, features, or discounts, such as an Auto Pay discount.”

 The updated Total 5G Unlimited and Total 5G+ Unlimited plans both include access to Verizon’s 5G “UltraWide band” network ([C-band 5G](https://data-recovery.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-data-destruction-insightful-articles-and-best-practices-curated-by-stellar/)), giving you much faster speeds in much of the United States. The cheapest Base 5G plan is limited to regular Verizon 5G and 4G LTE.

 You can sign up for the new plans from the [Total Wireless website](https://totalwireless.sjv.io/c/156932/2091082/15774?subId1=htgnew5gplans).
