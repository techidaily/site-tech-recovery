##  How Can I Screen Share Netflix? 

 There are a number of apps and extensions for screen sharing Netflix, though most of them are restricted to a single type of device that can limit who can participate. Rave fixes this problem by providing completely free stand-alone apps for Macs and Windows computers in addition to iOS and Android smart devices.

[ Download Rave ](https://rave.io) 

 Here’s how to use Rave to watch Netflix with others at the same time.

 These instructions show how to begin a Netflix screen share on a Windows computer and then join in from an iPhone but the process can be repeated from any device with Rave installed. The steps are identical no matter what you’re using.

1. After downloading and installing Rave, open the app on your device.
2. Log into Rave by selecting either your Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), or Google account.

##  Other Ways to Watch Netflix With Friends at the Same Time
