* Incredible customization power.
* Convert to-do lists, notes, messages, and emails.

 This app integrates with iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch to type on the go. It does not support a stylus. Also, like other alternatives, the Pro version opens up a lot more customization power, including editing actions and themes and custom tagging.
