Whether the person you are shopping for has been a long-time homeowner or just moved into their college dorm, there is one thing they can all use a hand with--cleaning. Although cleaning your floors can be one of the most dreadful chores, it is something that has to be done on a pretty consistent basis to upkeep your living space. 

That's why a robot vacuum is such a great gift everyone can enjoy. The Roomba j7+ earned a spot as [ZDNET's best robot vacuum overall](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/kitchen-household/best-robot-vacuum/)because of its impressive capabilities, which include a self-emptying auto-empty base, PrecisionVision Navigation to recognize and avoid common household objects, and multi-surface compatibility. 

Although the price may seem steep, you can score a deal multiple times throughout the year, including Black Friday, which is right around the corner. Right now, you can score the Roomba j7+ for almost 25% off on Walmart.

If you or anyone you know is anything like me, losing things is an everyday activity. Whether it's my keys, wallet, or remote control, I'm always frantically searching for my belongings--until I started pinging them with AirTags. 

AirTags are so simple to set up and track with your iPhone detecting the tag as soon as you unbox it and pull the paper insert out. Then, all you have to do is name it and place it on what you'd like to track, and it will automatically appear on your Apple's Find My Network. 

There are so many uses for AirTags; I have even opted to place two AirTags on my dogs to make sure that if they ever get loose, I will be able to find them. Because of its low price-point and compact size, this product could be a great stocking stuffer as well as a stand-alone gift.

Whether the person you are shopping for loves to cook or bake, this product will facilitate it all. KitchenAids have become a staple in the stand mixer space, and for good reason. This stand mixer has incredible power, making even the most tedious of mixing tasks an easy lift. 

For example, meringue cookies are one of my favorite things to make. However, if you have ever made meringue, you know it takes a while to beat the eggs until they fluff up to the perfect consistency. With the KitchenAid, what would typically take me about 40 minutes to beat by hand is finished in a fraction of the time. 

There are also many attachments that make the KitchenAid more than just a stand mixer; it is also a pasta maker, ice cream maker, slicer, shredder, and more. Even though it has a higher price tag than many competitors, the high quality of the appliance is worth the investment.

If you know any working professional who would use a business card, this gift will blow their mind. Whenever I go to a professional event and whip out my Linq card, it always causes an amazed reaction from the person seeking my contact information. 

Instead of handing out an antiquated physical business card that most people lose anyway, all you have to do is have the person tap your card with their phone. Since the card is NFC-enabled, the other person will have your contact information that you set up on the Linq app automatically appear.

The curvature of the monitor also adds to the comfort of staring at a screen by reducing eyestrain. This particular monitor was picked as [ZDNET's best mid-range Phillips large monitor](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-large-monitor/) because of its lower price point, compared to other monitors of that size. Despite the lower price point, it still has compelling features such as a built-in docking session, multiple ports, and a widescreen 21:9 aspect ratio.
