## Troubleshooting 'Missing' d3dx9_39.dll Error – Fixes Unveiled
 Any of Microsoft's operating systems since Windows 98 may be affected by d3dx9\_39.dll and other DirectX issues. This includes Windows 11, Windows 10, etc.  

## How to Fix D3dx9\_39.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Don't download the[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) from a "DLL download" site. There are a number of reasons[why downloading DLLs like that is almost always a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you already have, delete the file immediately and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet. The error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version of DirectX will fix the "not found" error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the error, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD.  
 Usually, if a game or another program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will include a copy on the installation disc. Sometimes, though not often, this version is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.  
 The DirectX program you're looking for might be named_dxsetup_ or something similar. One quick way to find it is to search with a tool like [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) .
4. [Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something might have happened to the files in the program that work with d3dx9\_39.dll and a reinstallation could do the trick.  
 Sometimes, even after an uninstallation, files are left over that could still be causing issues that ultimately show an error message. Try a[free uninstaller tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-uninstaller-programs-2625188) instead so that you can be sure that the entire program, and all of its related files, are deleted before reinstalling it.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_39.dll file from the latest DirectX package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your error, try extracting the file individually from the DirectX installation package.
6. [Update the drivers for your video card](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . While it's not the most common solution, in some situations updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the video card in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.

## Causes of D3dx9\_39.dll Errors

 The d3dx9\_39.dll file is one of many files contained in the Microsoft DirectX software collection. This means issues related to this file are caused in one way or another by a problem with DirectX.

 Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows based games and advanced graphics programs, errors usually show up only when using these programs.

* **D3DX9\_39.DLL Not Found**
* **D3dx9\_39.dll not found. Reinstalling might help fix this**
* **File d3dx9\_39.dll not found**
* **The file d3dx9\_39.dll is missing**

 The error could apply to any program that utilizes DirectX, but it usually applies to video games. It might be seen when the program or game is first starting or at some point during the initial installation.

 Some common games that have been known to generate these errors include _Combat Arms, Evidyon: Project Volucris, League of Legends, Prince of Persia, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War_ , and more.
