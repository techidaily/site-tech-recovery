## Method 1: Disable Fast Startup

```` `` The first quick and easy method to solve the problem is to disable Fast Startup on your Windows 10 device.

 Fast Startup is a default-enabled feature in Windows 10\. It is supposed to reduce startup time by pre-loading some boot information before your PC shuts off. It works similarly as Hibernation. But many users have reported it’s causing issues.

## Method 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If there are any old or corrupted drivers on your Windows 10 PC, this can cause your computer to boot slowly. You can update your device drivers to solve your problem.
