## Galaxy Z Fold 6 Specs and Features

 The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is_slightly_ larger than its predecessor, but it's unlikely you'll notice. The main display remains at 7.6 inches, but the cover screen has grown by one-tenth of an inch to 6.3 inches. Both displays have a 120Hz variable refresh rate. The phone also weighs a little less, coming in at just under 240g vs. the 253g Fold 5.

 Unlike the Z Flip 6, which got a larger battery this year, the Z Fold 6's is the same as its predecessor's: 4,400mAh. That's still a pretty big battery, and with a more efficient processor–the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3–the Fold 6 should see improved battery life even without more capacity.  

 As for camera specs, there's a 4MP under-display lens and a 10MP option for selfies. Here's the rear triple camera setup:

* 50MP wide
* 12MP ultra-wide
* 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom and 30x space zoom

Samsung

 The storage and RAM in the Z Fold 6 is identical to the Z Fold 5\. Options include 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. All three are equipped with 12GB of RAM.

 This phone ships with[Android 14](https://www.lifewire.com/android-14-7496192) and One UI 6.1.1\. Here are some notable software features:

* The AI-powered[Google Gemini](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-bard-7151624) has replaced Google Assistant. It's aware of context, so you can pull it up while viewing an image, video, or text to get relevant information.
* The built-in Notes app can pull text out of PDF files and translate, transcript, and summarize your voice recordings with Note Assist.
* Composer is a new feature built into Samsung Keyboard that can grasp your tone from past social media posts to help generate text that sounds more like you.
* Sketch to image is a new feature that helps you generate images based on sketches you make with the S Pen.
* To aid translations, Galaxy AI powers a new conversation mode that lets two people view translations in real time on the main and cover screens. And Live Translate works across some third-party calling apps in addition to the built-in Phone app.
* Photo Assist provides AI-driven, image-editing tools.
* Portrait Studio provides new looks for your images, like cartoon or watercolor styles.
* Instant Slow-mo adds frames to existing videos to make them play back more slowly.
