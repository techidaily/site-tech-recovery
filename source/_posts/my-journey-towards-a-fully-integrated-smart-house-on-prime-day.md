## My Journey Towards a Fully-Integrated Smart House on Prime Day

Prime Day is a perfect time to start building—or adding onto—your smart home, especially if you use Alexa.

 It comes as no shock that there are a bunch of great [Prime Day sales](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-still-using-pattern-locks-with-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/) on smart home devices—besides discounts on televisions, you can always count on being able to buy a [smart home hub](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-vivo-y100i-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/) or [smart lights](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/1721479062545-experiencing-wi-fi-woes-let-us-show-you-how-to-connect-your-iphone-to-any-computer/) on the cheap.

 But the sales never really tempted me. While the convenience of using a smart speaker or a phone to control my lights or remind me of something when I ignore my phone sounded nice, even on sale, the prices seemed too high for something I ultimately didn't need. This Prime Day, however, Amazon finally convinced me to start building my smart home.

 It started with [Govee's early Prime Day deals](https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-digital-expansion-social-story-downloader-for-2024/) (which are still live) and picked up this [floor lamp](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B099WTN2TR?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) that's perfect for small spaces. But as I took stock of everything, I realized that I needed a Bluetooth speaker for my bedroom to listen to white noise while I slept and not kill my phone's battery listening to YouTube. A [smart alarm clock](https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-guide-to-personalize-and-change-video-covers-on-facebook-for-2024/) could do the trick, but I wasn't willing to put down the premium price clocks like the [Hatch Restore 2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5S7K1JK?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) commanded.

 Instead, I went for the [Echo Pop](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-sound-compact-speaker-Lavender/dp/B09ZXJDSL5?tag=htgprimedaysite-20). It's an impulse buy at $17.99, it's small, it looks nice, and it does exactly what I need it to do. The Echo Pop doesn't have the fancy bells and whistles the new [Echo Spot Alarm Clock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFCBKXWL?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) does, but if I end up not liking Amazon's smart ecosystem, I'm not sweating as much over the lost cost.

 Better yet, the Govee lamp I bought works with Alexa, so I can use the Echo Pop to control it, whether that's turning the light on and off or anything else.

At only $17.99, now is the perfect time to start building your smart home ecosystem.

 Of course, two devices that link together don't make a complete smart home—but it's a start, and if I like Alexa, I'll surely be taking advantage of future sales to keep building it up.

 Prime Day only lasts until the end of the day, though, so if you're eyeing an Echo Spot or anything else, make sure to grab it now!
