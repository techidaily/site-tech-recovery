## Discover the Best Places to Get Free eBooks Online - Top 17 Picks
 Free books on nearly any subject you can think of are all over the internet, ready to be downloaded, read, and shared. These are our favorite sites with free books covering a wide variety of subjects.

 A huge quantity of books previously unavailable to the public was released starting in 2019 thanks to the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998\. Because of an amendment to that act, works published between 1923 and 1977 can enter the public domain 95 years after their creation. Many of the sites listed below give access to the tens of thousands of books (plus movies, songs, and cartoons) available under this act. Downloads should be free and without retribution under U.S. copyright law.

 What We Like

* Over 70,000 titles.
* Wide variety of formats.
* Top 100 list aids discoverability.

 What We Don't Like

* Majority of books are in English only.
* Books may not be free outside the U.S.

 Project Gutenberg is one of the largest and oldest sources for free books on the web, with over 70,000 downloadable titles available in a wide variety of formats. The vast majority are released in English, but there are other languages available.

 If you already know what you're looking for, search the database by author name, title, language, or subject. You can also check out the[top 100 list to see what other people are downloading](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top) .

 What We Like

* Selection includes more than just classics and Creative Commons books.
* Great categorization makes finding what you love easier.
* Variety of download formats.

 What We Don't Like

* A few areas of the site hardly ever receive updates.
* Some books do cost money.

 ManyBooks is one of the best resources on the web for free books in a variety of download formats. There are hundreds of titles here in all sorts of interesting genres, and they're completely free. Not all the books are classics, so if you're into other genres, this site is a good alternative to others in this list.

 Unlike some sites, this one lets you browse free books by language. You can also search by author and genre. The[ManyBooks Articles](https://manybooks.net/articles) page is another handy way to browse their collection, with articles such as "Books Like A Match Made in Venice" and reviews.

 Downloading books requires a free user account unless there's a link to Amazon, in which case you can grab it with your Amazon account. There are often several download options, like EPUB, PDF, AZW3, and FB2\. They're also readable online through the site's built-in book reader.

 What We Like

* Good alternative if Internet Archive is too confusing.
* Multiple formats available.

 What We Don't Like

* Just pulls results from Internet Archive.
* Some books can only be borrowed.

 Open Library is a search tool that pulls data from Internet Archive. You might use it if that site (listed above) isn't helping you find the right book. You can search hundreds of thousands of books here, and most are in multiple formats such as PDF, ePub, and Daisy.

 I particularly like the[Library Explorer](https://openlibrary.org/explore) section because it feels like I'm looking through real bookshelves!

 You can search for ebooks specifically by checking the**Ebooks** option after running a search.

 What We Like

* Free audiobooks.
* Audiobooks are available in multiple languages.
* Large collection of children's audiobooks.

 What We Don't Like

* Books are read by volunteers, which means performances can be hit or miss.
* Many listed authors have zero books available.

 If you've been looking for a great place to[find free audiobooks](https://www.lifewire.com/free-audio-books-the-15-best-sources-online-1357952) , visiting Librivox is a good start. The site has many volunteers who work to release quality recordings of classic books. All the titles here are free, which is good news for those of us who've had to pony up ridiculously high fees for substandard audiobooks.

 I like to use the[New Releases RSS feed](https://librivox.org/pages/librivox-feeds/) with a feed reader service to stay on top of new additions.

 What We Like

* Books across a wide variety of interests.
* You can sort by view count or popularity.
* Several downloading options.

 What We Don't Like

* It can be difficult finding exactly what you want from numerous search results.
* Site can be slow to respond.

 Internet Archive has a digital library full of fiction, popular books, children's books, historical texts, and academic books. The free books on this site span every possible interest.

 You can sort these books by view count to see the most popular ones and sort by title or date published. Another way I like to scour the millions of books on this site is through collections such as_California Digital Library_ ,_Getty Research Institute_ , and_Boston Public Library_ .

 There are usually several download options if you don't want to read the book online, such as PDF, EPUB, and Kindle.

 What We Like

* Easily readable format.
* You can read right in the browser.
* No account necessary.

 What We Don't Like

* Bare bones website.
* Lacks books in foreign languages (except some German).
* Lacks advanced search features.

 Authorama offers a good selection of current and classic books from a variety of authors. They're organized alphabetically by the author’s last name and are written in HTML and XHTML, which means they're in an easily readable format. Most books here are featured in English, but there are quite a few German language texts as well.

 This site offers a good selection of high-quality, free books you can read in your browser. These are in the public domain, which means they're freely accessible and allowed to be distributed. In other words, you don't need to worry if you're looking at something illegal.

 The website is really simple to use, maybe_too_ simple. The search box is basic and the only other way to find books is by scrolling through the author list. But, you don't need a user account to read these titles online, and they're all formatted nicely.

 What We Like

* Hundreds of free books.
* Download or view online in your browser.

 What We Don't Like

* Must go through a "checkout" process even though they're free.
* Some books need special software for offline reading.

Use the link below to access a list of a few hundred completely free eBooks that you can read online or download as an[ACSM file](https://www.lifewire.com/acsm-file-4147031) —those are DRM-protected files that work with Adobe Digital Editions (directions are available on the download page).

 The other way is to[browse their DRM-free eBooks](https://www.ebooks.com/drm-free/) . Some of these aren't free to download, but the ones that are can be saved and opened like any EPUB file.

 You can filter these books by subject, like computers or religion, or by a number of fiction and non-fiction subcategories. There's also a format (PDF or EPUB), release date, and language filter.
