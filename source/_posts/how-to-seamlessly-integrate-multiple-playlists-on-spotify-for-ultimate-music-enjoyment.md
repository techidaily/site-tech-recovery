### What to Know

* Desktop app: Select the songs you want to move. Right-click the selection and choose**Add to playlist** .
* Mobile app: Open**Your Library** and locate the song. Select the**three-dot** menu and then tap**Add to playlist** .
* You can copy specific songs or everything, and they can go into a new playlist or an existing one.

 Although Spotify lacks a built-in method for combining playlists, it’s still possible to merge two or more Spotify playlists by following a few steps. This article will teach you how to streamline your Spotify playlists using the desktop and mobile apps.

## How to Combine Two Playlists on Spotify With the Desktop App

 The easiest way to merge two or more playlists on Spotify is by manually copying over songs from one or more playlists to a new playlist. This works best in the desktop app. Here are those directions:

 The process of merging playlists is nearly identical on Windows and Mac. The screenshots below correspond to the Spotify app for Mac, but Windows-specific directions are noted where appropriate.

1. Open the app and select the playlist you’d like to move songs from.

2. Press**Cmd** +**A** (Mac) or**Ctrl** +**A** (Windows) to select all songs in the playlist. You can also hold down**Cmd** or**Ctrl** to select individual songs.

3. Right-click the selection and choose**Add to playlist** . Then, pick which playlist to copy the songs to, or select**New playlist** to make a new one.

 Since you’re only copying songs from one playlist to another, your old playlist will remain unaffected after completing these steps. If you want to delete the old playlist, find it from the left-side menu, right-click it, and choose**Delete** .

## How to Combine Spotify Playlists in the Mobile App  

 Spotify's mobile app lets you merge two playlists by selecting each song one at a time, or you can copy an entire playlist into another playlist. Here's how to do both:
4. Tap**Your Library** at the bottom.

5. Select**Playlists** and then open the playlist you want to copy songs from.
6. To transfer the whole playlist at once, tap the**three dots** under the playlist name. If you want to pick and choose which songs to copy over, select the summary that shows the contents of the playlist, and then tap the three dots next to the specific track you want to copy.

## Can You Add a Whole Playlist to Another Playlist on Spotify?  

 Spotify limits playlists to 10,000 songs, so as long as you don’t exceed that number, you should have no trouble copying an entire playlist into another one. Follow the instructions outlined above to do this on desktop or mobile.

 FAQ  

* How do I merge playlists on Spotify web player?  
    You can merge playlists in the Spotify web player the same way you can in the app. Select multiple tracks or locate the three-dot menu next to a singe song, then right-click it and select**Add to playlist** to see your options. The web version works best for playing existing playlists and[creating new Spotify playlists](https://www.lifewire.com/make-a-playlist-on-spotify-4138575) .  
* How do I merge Spotify playlists and remove duplicates?  
    Spotify will notify you if you're copying songs that already exist in the merged playlist. Select**Add new ones** on desktop or**Cancel** on mobile to avoid duplicate songs when combining lists. To remove duplicates after the fact manually, sort the playlist by title so you can easily find them.
