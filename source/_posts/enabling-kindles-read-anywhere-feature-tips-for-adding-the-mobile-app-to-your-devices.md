There was a long time that I think it is easy to add mobi to kindle app, just with usb then copy. But after I searched some forums, this view changed.

Firstly I'm surprised that there are so many people asking questions like "how do I add my .mobi files to kindle app on iPad". After I finished reading their questions, I tried some different ways, and then collected those frequently asked questions together in this article. This is also the reason that I write this post. Trust me this is what you are searching for if you don't know or met some problems during adding mobi files to kindle app. If you want to [read mobi on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), there are two ways we've illustrated before.

In order to make sure you can get a better understanding, I divide kindle app into several parts, kindle for android app, kindle for iPad /iPhone / iPod app, Kindle for PC, Kindle for Mac, even more.

### Add mobi to Kindle app android

This part is written for those people who owned an android tablet or smart phone. To add a mobi file to your kindle app for android, follow these steps below.![android](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/android.png)

1 Connect Android to computer

Connect your android device to computer via USB cable please. 

2 Copy mobi to Kindle folder

After connected, in common it will show up a disk drive on your computer. Then from your android device, find this folder "Kindle", copy and paste your .mobi books to that folder of your android.

![add mobi to kindle android app](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-mobi-to-kindle-android.png)

3 Launch Kindle app on Android

Disconnect your android tablet or phone from computer please. Then launch the Kindle app on your android. After you run the kindle app, from the menu in the top left corner, click on "On Device", you will see your added mobi files.

![check added mobi files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/mobi-added-on-kindle-android.png)

**Tips:** If you access to the kindle app with your own amazon account (wifi connected), your perchased mobi files will be synced to this app automatically, click on "Books" to check.

### Add mobi to Kindle app iPad

This part is for you if you owned an iPad, iPhone or iPod. Reading mobi files On iOS devices with Kindle app.![ios devices](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ios.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
1 Connect iOS device to computer

Connect your iPad / iPhone to your computer via USB cable.

2 Copy mobi using file sharing

At this step ensure that your iTunes is 9.1 version or later. Click here for [latest version of iTunes](http://apple.com/itunes). Of course kindle app should be installed, too.

Launch iTunes 9.1 or later on your computer (where your ebooks downloaded). Find "Devices" in iTunes, on the left sidebar select your iOS device first. Then select â€œApps" from the top menu bar of iTunes window. Scroll down to find the "Fire Sharing" section.

Under the file sharing section, you will find some apps installed on your iOS device that support file sharing. Select "Kindle" app, then drag .mobi ebook files to "kindle" box.

![file sharing](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/file-sharing.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3 Open kindle app on iPad/iPhone

Disconnect your ios device from computer, then launch the kindle app please. Now these files should appear on your iPhone / iPad when you open the Kindle app.

**Note:** If you can't see "Fire Sharing" , or you can't update your iTunes to 9.1 or later, it means that you can't transfer your mobi files to the kindle app on iPad / iPhone with iTunes directly. To resolve this problem, here are 2 methods for you:

##### Method 1: Send to Kindle E-mail address

Just manage your kindle to send your mobi files to your kindle e-mail address, then sync your files, ok.

##### Method 2: Convert mobi to epub for reading in iBooks

As iBooks is the built-in reading app for ios devices, so since we can't read mobi books with kindle app successfully, why not change another good app to read those mobi files?

But as we known that iBooks only supporst files purchased from iBooks stores or some personal files with epub or pdf, so here we need to convert mobi to epub or pdf format. Recommend you a tool [ultimate converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), the best ebook converter.

Residing in my Android Download folder, my mobi file was too large to send/share to Kindle App (50MB max). Searching for a solution, I found this page, connected phone to my PC via USB, copied and pasted file directly to kindle folder, and worked as described. Seems so simple now. So pleased to have found this. Thanks!

There is a way to do it on the windows app. It is just a case of finding where to put it as it is in a hidden folder.

This information is no longer relevant and will not work on modern phones, as there is no longer a "kindle" folder.

The iPhone is without the "Kindle" folder. But the Android phone, it still has the "Kindle" folder.

Since the HP computer does not support iBooks, I am not sure how can you transfer your books from Ipad to the computer. May I ask which online store do you purchase these books?

The kindle folder on my android has dozens of sub folders within sub folders. Where do I put the mobi file within that network of folders? Not in the main file. Please update this.

Seems like a dumb question, but I don't have a Kindle folder (that I can find) on my phone (Samsung S9). I know it must be there because I have no problem using the app for books I bought from Amazon...I'm thinking it must be hidden and I don't know how to expose it!!

 I'd appreciate any help!

 Thanks,
