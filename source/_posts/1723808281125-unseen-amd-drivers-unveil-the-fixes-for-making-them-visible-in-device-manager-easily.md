 Before we dive into anything advanced, please make sure you’ve tried to reboot your PC. Sometimes a simple restart can solve many random computer issues.

## Fix 1: Show hidden devices in Device Manager

 The first thing you can check is to see if your AMD graphics card is listed as a hidden device in Device Manager. If it’s just hidden, you can simply enable it in Device Manager. Here’s how:

1. Right-click the**Start button** and click**Device Manager** .

3. You can check if your AMD graphics card shows up under the Display adapters section.

If this doesn’t work for you, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A corrupted or outdated graphics driver may cause the graphic card to disappear in the Device Manager. You may need to update your graphics driver to solve this issue.

 Normally you can find the exact driver for your graphics card on the AMD website and install it via Device Manager. As your AMD graphics card doesn’t show up in Device Manager now, you’ll need to use either the AMD Radeon software or a third-party tool.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

## Fix 3: Check for the latest Windows updates

 It’s important to keep your system up-to-date. According to many users’ reports, we’ve found that installing the latest Windows updates may solve this issue. Meanwhile, some users also mentioned that they encountered this error after they updated their OS, and rolling back the update solved the issue for them.

 In both cases, you’ll need to check for the latest Windows updates and decide if you need an update or a rollback. Below are the steps to install and uninstall Windows updates:

 You may be prompted to restart your PC during the following process. Make sure you save your work and important files in advance.

#### Install the latest Windows updates

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .

 If you still can’t see your AMD graphics card in Device Manager, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 4: Restore BIOS

 If the fixes above didn’t solve your problem, you may need to restore the BIOS settings on your PC. This will clear the BIOS settings to default but won’t erase any data on your PC. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows key** to bring up the search menu, type**recovery** , then click**Recovery options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_17-10-46.png)
2. Under Advanced Startup, click**Restart now** .

3. Click**Troubleshoot** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-17_17-11-38.png)
4. Click**Advanced options** .

5. Click**UEFI Firmware Settings** .

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

7. Once you enter the UEFI (BIOS) menu, select**Load Setup Defaults** . The interface and phrasing can vary, so you may need to navigate around and look for the following expressions or similar ones:**Load Default options** ,**Setup Defaults** ,**Reset to Defaults** , or**Load Optimized Defaults** .
8. Save your changes and reboot your PC.

 If your graphics card is still not showing up in Device Manager, you may need to update your BIOS or check for hardware issues.
