 At CES 2023, Sony and Honda gave a name to their joint Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) electric vehicle venture: Afeela. This new electric vehicle (EV) brand is moving ever closer beyond concept to debuting its first EV sedan, which will draw on Sony‚Äôs and numerous other partners‚Äô gaming, artificial intelligence (AI), and entertainment prowess. Here‚Äôs what we know about the forthcoming Sony car (Afeela).

##  When Will the Sony Car (Afeela) Be Released? 

 When Sony and Honda announced their plans for an EV, they also suggested a 2026 release. Plans look on track to bring the Afeela to market in North America first sometime in 2026\. 

 Orders will be taken in the first half of next year, potentially allowing US drivers to be behind the wheel by spring 2026.

###  Lifewire's Release Date Estimate

 The Afeela looks poised to be available in North America by spring 2026.

##  Sony Car (Afeela) Price Rumors 

[ According to The Verge's early reporting](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23539863/sony-honda-electric-vehicle-afeela-ces-reveal-photos) , the Afeela‚Äôs pricing will match competitors in the luxury vehicle space, like Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Porsche, including possible subscription models to some of its services. But competition with and resemblance to the Tesla, specifically the Tesla Model S, feels pretty undeniable. Some even see similarities to models such as the Porsche 911.

 Trim levels and exact offerings are yet unknown, but[ Car and Driver estimates](https://www.caranddriver.com/afeela/ev-sedan) the Afeela will be $45,000\. On the other hand,[ Nikkei Asia reports](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Sony-and-Honda-EV-venture-to-launch-SUV-and-compact-before-2030) that the Afeela EV sedan will likely hover above 10 million yen, which is the equivalent of about $66,143.

 As concept-to-production details take shape, we expect to hear more rumors about pricing, so stay tuned.

## Pre-Order Information 

 Sony Car pre-ordering looks like it will start in the first few months of 2025\. All signs point to US orders first, followed by pre-orders and debuts in the Japanese and European markets. 

 We‚Äôll make updates here as we learn more.

## Sony Car (Afeela) Features 

 The Sony car has been a concept for a while, but with the updated prototype unveiled at CES 2024 and recent announcements about collaborations with the likes of Microsoft and Epic Games, the expected feature set is starting to take shape in the production-ready model.

 Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen in the mix from Sony Honda Mobility:

* **Customizable Media Bar** : One distinctive exterior highlight is the Media Bar, a thin display between the headlights, which serves as a sort of self-expression and communication tool. Some of its tricks include charging indicator levels and displaying digital stickers.
* **Built-in Microsoft AI assistant** : The Afeela will get a[ personal assistant using Microsoft Azure OpenAI](https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2024-01-08%5F4/) . This assistant, dubbed the Mobility Personal Agent, is part of the company‚Äôs vision for an ‚Äúadvanced voice-enabled system that delivers seamless communication with natural language and conversation-like interactions.‚Äù
* **Immersive infotainment with a gaming bent** : The Afeela will be like a moving movie theater with infotainment screens throughout, movie and music choices for passengers, and a noise-canceling, spatial audio sound system. SHM has also announced it‚Äôs working with Epic Games and its Unreal Engine, the power behind_Fortnite_ , to develop an immersive augmented reality (AR) experience. This feature will look like 3D views of the road from any angle but also offer a gamified view of real-life objects.

Sony Honda Mobility

 Another key SHM partnership is with Polyphony Digital, which came to life when the Afeela prototype became available in the racing simulation game_Gran Turismo 7_ with an April patch.[ MotorTrend](https://www.motortrend.com/features/sony-afeela-ev-sedan-virtual-first-drive-playstation-gran-turismo/) speculates that the game dimensions indicate the real-life figures, similar to a 2024 Honda Accord. 

 The game version of the Sony Car also allows users to play PlayStation games on the in-cabin infotainment system via[ Remote Play](https://www.lifewire.com/remote-play-ps5-games-on-android-5089611) .

 How much more actual integrated gaming will be possible in the real Aleefa is still unknown and something we‚Äôll be on the lookout for.

##  Sony Car (Afeela) Specs and Hardware 

 The 2024 Sony car prototype offers some clues about the production model's specs. 

* **Dimensions** : 193.5 x 74.8 x 57.4 inches
* **Drivetrain** : All-wheel drive
* **Motors** : Two 1889kW
* **Battery** : 91kWh lithium-ion

[  Level 1 vs. Level 2 vs. Level 3 Charging Explained ](https://www.lifewire.com/ev-charging-levels-explained-5201716) 

 On the safety and mobility fronts, we also know that the Sony car will use 45 cameras and sensors for a full-picture traffic view, sense when drivers approach the vehicle and open the door automatically, and self-park after the driver exits.
