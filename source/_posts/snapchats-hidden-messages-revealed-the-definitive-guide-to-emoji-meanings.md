## Snapchat's Hidden Messages Revealed: The Definitive Guide to Emoji Meanings

Close 

 Snapchat users who send and receive multiple snaps with friends will notice little emoji icons that appear next to their friends' names in the chat tab. Meanings differ depending on friend status, interactions, and the length of time you've been friends with someone.

 This article explains Snapchat emojis and what they mean. Snapchat continually adds and removes friend emojis; the list below includes past and present ones. Information in this article applies to the Snapchat app for iOS and Android.  

You can also customize Snapchat emojis. This is covered below.

## Yellow Heart (Besties) 💛 

 You're both best friends. You send the most snaps to this friend, and they send the most snaps to you.

## Red Heart (BFF) ❤️ 

 A yellow heart becomes a red heart when you remain each other's BFF for a period of two weeks.

##  Two Pink Hearts (Super BFF) 💕 

 If you see the two pink hearts beside a friend's username, it means that this friend has been your number one best friend on Snapchat, or your "Super BFF," for two months in a row. It also means that you have been that friend's number one best friend out of all of their friends for two months as well.

 Due to a bug, the pink hearts emoji has been known to occasionally be replaced by a yellow heart.

## Grimacing Face 😬 

 A smiley bearing his teeth as if grimacing beside a friend's name means that your number one best friend is their number one best friend as well. In other words, you share a best friend.

## Smirking Face 😏 

 When you see an emoji with a smirk beside a friend's name, it means that you're that friend's best friend, but they're not your best friend (you have a different best friend).

## Baby 👶 

 A baby emoji appears immediately after you[ add someone as a friend](https://www.lifewire.com/add-friends-by-scanning-their-snapcodes-3486002) on Snapchat.

## Fire 🔥 

 If you're super active on Snapchat, you may see a fiery flame emoji next to someone's name, meaning you're on a "snapstreak." You've been snapping back and forth with them a lot over the past several days, and the longer you stick with it, the higher the snapstreak number you'll see beside the Fire emoji.

## Hourglass ⌛

## 100💯 

 You'll see 100 next to Fire emoji when you snap back and forth for 100 days in a row.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  Other Emojis You Might See That Aren't Generated by Snapchat 

 Snapchat automatically adds the above emojis to people's profiles and avatars, but you may run into some other ones in usernames and elsewhere that the platform doesn't make. Here are some of them:

* Star Eye 🤩: People may use the smiley emoji with stars for eyes when they spot a celebrity or other person they admire. They can also use it to describe admiration or being impressed.
* Purple Heart 💜: Snapchat used to put these on people's profiles during their birthday months. Along with general feelings of affection, fans of the Korean boy band BTS also use the purple heart to show their appreciation.
* Green Heart 💚: Just like with the purple heart, you can use the green heart to spot K-pop fans. This one represents NCT.
* Upside-Down Smiley 🙃: The inverted smiley face can mean a few things, including embarrassment, irony, or that you're joking.
* Wrapped Gift 🎁: The wrapped present emoji doesn't have any special meaning on Snapchat other than what it represents. People typically use it around special occasions like birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries.
* Brown Heart 🤎: The brown heart gained popularity among supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. It reflects pride, solidarity, and joy.

##  How to Customize Friend Emojis 

 You can actually[ change the emojis](https://www.lifewire.com/change-emojis-in-snapchat-5118506) for all the interactions listed above so that you see the exact emojis you want to see next to your friends' names. For example, do this if you want your number one best friend for two months to be the poop emoji instead of the two pink hearts:

1. Open Snapchat and tap your**profile** icon at the top of the app.
2. Tap the**gear** icon.
3. On iOS, tap**Manage** under**Additional Services** , and then tap**Friend Emojis** .  
 On Android, tap**Customize Emojis** under**Features** .

4. Tap**Super BFF** .
5. Tap the**poop emoji** (or anything else). Now, any time you have a Super BFF, this emoji will appear next to that friend's name in the chat tab.

##  Snapchat's Shift From Best Friends to Friend Emojis 

 Older versions of Snapchat included the[ best friends feature](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-or-change-snapchat-best-friends-3485996) , which listed 3-7 of the friends you snapped with the most at the top of your friend list. In fact, you could tap on anyone's username to reveal who their best friends were. Due to privacy concerns from Snapchat users, the best friends feature was taken away via an update in 2015.

 You can still see your own best friends from the chat tab; tap**Best Friends** to see your list.

## What Are Snapchat Emojis? 

 Snapchat tracks your messaging habits with your friends and assigns Friend emojis to represent the current status of your level of interaction with other users. As you continue to send and receive messages, the emojis will change over time. Likewise, if you stop messaging someone for a while, the emoji may disappear completely.

 Your Friend emojis are not public; they are only visible to you. Emojis will look different depending on which platform you're using (iOS or Android).

 Use[ Bitmoji](https://www.lifewire.com/bitmoji-explained-4137793) to make a personalized emoji that you can use on Snapchat. Bitmoji also works with Facebook, Gmail, and Slack.
