## Immersive Brain Teasers for Your iOS Device - Alternatives to The Room and Myst
 There's something about overcoming a massive challenge that adds an excitement level and sense of achievement that is simply not seen in more casual games. This is the reason why_Myst_ was so popular back in the early 90s and why_The Room_ was so popular for the iPhone and[iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-comparison-chart-1994214) .

 And yet like all games similar to_Myst_ and_The Room_ , when it's done, it's done. Luckily The Room has spawned[The Room 2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-room-two/id667362389) ,[The Room 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-room-three/id918054748) , and[The Room 4](https://apps.apple.com/app/the-room-old-sins/id1286676015) , but if you've gone through the sequels and are looking for the next great challenge, here are a few great puzzle games to download.

## realMyst: Free-Roaming Exploration

![Screenshot of realMyst](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/H58NPDZH5N-3GthK0DEJVUoBkbI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/real_myst-5be1e3e34cedfd0026cc5261.png)

 What We Like

* Sequel to_Myst_ .
* Great graphics.
* Original_Myst_ ages plus Rime Age.

 What We Don't Like

* Some user interface quirks on iPhone.
* Could feel a bit cramped to some.

 We might as well start with the free-roaming version of the godfather of all great puzzle games. The_realMyst_ sequel to the best selling game of the 90's was a re-imagining of the original that put you into the 2D world, allowing you to explore it in all of its glory.

 If you loved_The Room_ and never played_Myst_ , this one is a must.

## Machinarium: Best for Total Focus

![Screenshot from the Machinarium.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/FYA4FeU-Hxo3JIpkSPKZpbzn9j8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/machinarium-5716580b3df78c3fa2b158ff.png)

 What We Like

* Entertaining combo of sci-fi and puzzle themes.
* High level of difficulty.
* Visually stunning.

 What We Don't Like

* Story on the short side.
* Somewhat repetitive.
* Might be too slow for some.

 It's puzzle-adventure meets[Wall-E](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/) . This fun game has you playing the role of a robot that can squish his body together and stretch out, allowing you to solve unique puzzles.

 Known for its high level of difficulty, this one isn't for those who want to run through the puzzles at breakneck speeds.

## The Silent Age: Best for Traveling Through Time

![Screenshot from The Silent Age](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/fI5zY2gj0FOivaFuUvSCJLqnDSc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/silentage-571658223df78c3fa2b159e6.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* Engaging time traveling theme.
* Immersive.
* Free to play.

 What We Don't Like

* Might be too brief for some.
* Second chapter sits behind considerable paywall.

 Unassuming Joe the Plumber is about to go on the adventure of his lifetime ... or perhaps two lifetimes. This time-traveling adventure game has you moving back and forth between 1972 and 2012 where mankind has become extinct.

 A nice twist on the puzzle adventure game, this one really nails the "present day" of 1972.

## Shadowmatic: Best Creative Puzzle Game

![A screenshot from the Shadowmatic game.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8jDmX-iIs1CCEJA0dp-pJ9v7Bxw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/shadowmatic-58062e405f9b5805c2070df6.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* Beautiful graphics.
* 130+ levels.
* Challenging but relaxing.

 What We Don't Like

* Hints require an in-app purchase.
* Full version is paid only.

 A beautiful game,_Shadowmatic_ takes the_Hidden Object_ game and turns it into a make-the-object game.

 The game goes through a series of rooms that each have different lighting and challenges you to rotate strange shapes hanging in the middle of the room to cast shadows into a specific form.

## House of Da Vinci: Best for Feeding Your Need for 'The Room'

![Screenshot of House of Da Vinci](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TS_IU-ZIjjqogKQdewuNnZhNXuk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/da_vinci-5be1e427c9e77c005192b948.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* Top-notch graphics.
* A great combo of challenge and length.
* Thematic overlaps with_The Room_ .

 What We Don't Like

* Some think it's a poor imitation of_The Room_ .
* User controls can be unintuitive.

_The House of Da Vinci_ is about as close to_The Room_ and its sequels as you can get without it being developed by Fireproof Games. This one is for those who really, really can't wait for the next in_The Room_ series.

 But while it's a Room clone, don't mistake it for being cheaply developed._House of Da Vinci_ is a high-quality game that will feed your need for a good puzzle solver.

## Agent A: Best for Comfortable Puzzle Solving

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 What We Like

* Retro styling.
* Five chapters.
* Appeals to fans of relaxed puzzle games.

 What We Don't Like

* Somewhat predictable.
* Not very innovative.
* Only chapter one is free.

 A puzzle solver that makes you feel like you are in a cartoon version of a James Bond film,_Agent A_ doesn't do too much that is new, but it does almost everything very good.

 You'll find the same basic tap-and-solve mechanics with plenty of items, clues, and puzzles strewn about the house.

## Device 6: Best Story Line in a Puzzle Game

![Screenshot of Device 6](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/UVdASdlhtxzdqNaavkJw-jDhtEA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/device_6-5be1e467c9e77c0051a892e2.png)

 What We Like

* Good writing.
* Imbued with a bit of humor.
* Has a novel-like quality.

 What We Don't Like

* A bit too short.

_Device 6_ takes the classic wake-up-with-no-memories theme and mixes in high doses of nostalgic text-based game play alongside the mobile world of images and videos.

 This is a well-written tale that will have you chuckling as you slowly discover more about Anna, the protagonist with the memory issues.

## The Tiny Bang Story: Best for Family Activities

![Screenshot of Tiny Bang Story](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/99HXcG-Pq_8ZONIroSvt337TMmc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/tiny_bang-5be1e4a7c9e77c0051a89f6c.PNG)

 What We Like

* Great for the whole family.
* Five chapters with 30+ brain teasers.
* Various musical themes.

 What We Don't Like

* A bit simplistic.
* Not the most interesting visuals.

 A beautiful blend of hidden object gameplay and difficult puzzles to solve wrapped in a cartoonish charm suitable for a toddler, this is the perfect game to play with the family.

 The puzzles may be too hard for an 8-year-old, but kids can join in the fun by helping spot some of the puzzle pieces that can easily blend into the environment, while adults will enjoy a challenging game.
