## vcomp.dll Cannot Be Located? Fix It Now with These Simple Steps
 You may not recognize the filename vcomp100.dll, but many programs that use Visual C++ (Microsoft C/C++ OpenMP Runtime) will. This DLL is a crucial system file is often used in Microsoft Windows. If reading about this file and its potential errors has you in a panic, continue reading below for possible solutions to rid yourself of the vcomp.dll not found or missing errors.  

![vcomp.dll error message in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BJ_7swiXEN7jRC65D4RQAXamZyk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/vcomp-dll-error-message-5abb9f6d04d1cf0036cf9d8c.png)

## How to Fix Vcomp.dll Not Found or Missing Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're listed below to address the more likely fixes first.

 Do not download vcomp.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Download the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26347) and run it. This will replace/restore the vcomp.dll with the most recent copy provided by Microsoft.  
 You're given a few download options for this update, based on the version of Windows you have installed—x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit). See[How to Tell if You Have Windows 64-bit or 32-bit](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) for help if you're not sure what to choose.  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Restore vcomp.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" vcomp.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
 Recovering a deleted copy of vcomp.dll with a file recovery program is a smart idea only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some vcomp.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the vcomp.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
5. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that's producing the vcomp.dll error. If the vcomp.dll error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling that program might help.
6. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other patches replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The vcomp.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
7. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause vcomp.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests, replace the memory or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
8. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
9. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair vcomp.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid vcomp.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners, but we've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
10. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the vcomp.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the vcomp.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
11. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any vcomp.dll errors persist. After a clean installation of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
