## Seven Ways to Fix a Fire Stick Remote

1. Install new batteries. The most common reason that Fire Stick remotes stop working is the batteries. Before replacing them, check that the batteries are installed correctly.

2. [Pair the remote with your Fire Stick or Fire TV](https://www.lifewire.com/pair-fire-stick-remote-5191441) . Sometimes, the remote unpairs with the streaming device even if you didn't intentionally do that.
3. Check for obstructions. Bluetooth devices like the Fire Stick remote have a theoretical range of about 30 feet, but many things can reduce it.  
 If the remote only works when you hold it behind your TV or are very close to your TV, use a Fire Stick extender to reposition the device.  
 If your Fire TV device is inside a cabinet, remove it and try the remote again.  
 You may need a longer extension to move the Fire Stick out from behind the TV if the TV is mounted in a recess or an entertainment cabinet.
4. Check to see if you have any of the following devices anywhere near your Fire Stick:  
   * Microwave ovens  
   * Wireless speakers  
   * Unshielded coaxial cables  
   * Wireless phones  
   * Wireless speakers  
   * Other wireless devices  
 Get your Amazon Fire device away from any of these devices. Or try shutting them down and unplugging them one at a time to identify the source of the interference.
5. Check compatibility between your Fire TV remote and Fire Stick or Fire TV devices. Not all Fire Sticks, Fire TV devices, and Fire TV remote work together. Before buying a remote, check the product description to make sure it works with your model.
6. [Use your smartphone as an Amazon Fire remote control](https://www.lifewire.com/use-phone-as-remote-control-for-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4571277) . Amazon has a Fire TV Remote app that you can pair with your device and use it to navigate.[Check hardware and OS compatibility](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G26ZQ5B29HKKMFPY&tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4177739%7Cn912f2e00fb9149619366aec9b901a04310%7C) first.

   * [Fire TV for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.storm.lightning.client.aosp) works with Android 6.0 or newer.  
   * [Fire TV for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id947984433) requires iOS 11 or newer.
7. Try[resetting your Fire Stick](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-fire-stick-4176100) to its factory settings if all else fails.

## What Causes a Fire Stick Remote to Stop Working?

 There are a lot of things that can cause a Fire Stick remote to stop working or prevent one from ever working in the first place. The most common issues include battery problems, obstructions that block the signal from the remote, and interference from other electronics.

 Here are the most common reasons for a Fire Stick remote to stop working:

* **Batteries:** The most common reason Fire Stick remotes stop working is battery problems. Improperly inserted batteries, low battery charge, and other related issues can all cause a Fire Stick remote to stop working.
* **Pairing:** If your remote isn't paired with your Fire Stick, it won't work. Replacement remotes always need to be paired before you use them.
* **Distance:** Fire Stick remotes use Bluetooth, not infrared, so they have a theoretical range of about 30 feet. The actual number is typically lower.
* **Obstructions:** You don't need a direct line of sight between your Fire Stick and remote, but obstructions can drastically reduce the range.
* **Interference:** Devices that interfere with Bluetooth connections can prevent your remote from working correctly.
* **Compatibility:** If you've purchased a replacement remote for your Fire Stick, ensure they're compatible.
* **Damage:** External damage, like water damage and internal faults due to failed components, can cause your Fire Stick remote to stop working.
