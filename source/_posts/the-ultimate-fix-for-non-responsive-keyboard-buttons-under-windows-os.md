## 1\. Certain keys don’t work

 If by saying keyboard not working, you meant that**certain keys** on your Logitech K780 keyboard don’t work as they used to, and the problem happen all of a sudden, please follow the 3 methods below to see if they help to sort the problem out.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1.1 Make sure that it’s not a hardware issue

 We first need to run a keyboard test with Command Prompt as admin to see if the problem is on the hardware front or the software front. To run the test:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Enter** at the same time to **run Command Prompt as administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 You’ll be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open Command Prompt as admin.
2. Type the keys that don’t work out of the blue in Command Prompt.

 If the failed keys**work** in Command Prompt, then the problem should be on the software front. Move forward to the other troubleshooting methods below.

 If the failed keys**don’t even work** in Command Prompt, the problem is very likely on the hardware front. So you should start to talk to Logitech support to see if they need to take the keyboard back for repair or replacement.

### 1.2 Reinstall the keyboard driver

 When you’ve made sure that the keyboard problem is not hardware-related, you can then try to reinstall the keyboard driver for Logitech K780 to see if it helps. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png)
2. Double-click to expand the**Keyboards** category, then right-click your Logitech K780 keyboard and select**Uninstall device** .

3. Tick the box for**Attempt to remove the driver for this device** and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-94.png)
4. Restart your computer afterward for the keyboard driver to be reinstalled automatically by Windows.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### 1.3 Consider a computer restore or a reset

 If the keys on your Logitech K780 keyboard stop working all of a sudden, you should try to see if you can unmake any changes made to your computer before the problem.

 If you’re not sure what changes were made that could cause the problem with your K780 keyboard, you can consider a computer restore. If you’re not sure how to do it, here’s a post for your reference: **[Repair Your Computer in Windows 10 Automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 If your system doesn’t have a restore point saved before the K780 keyboard problem, you may need to consider a computer refresh or a reset. To do so, here’s a post with detailed instructions: **[Windows 10 Refresh & Reset Easily](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 If the Logitech K780 keyboard still doesn’t work well after a system restore or a reset, then there should be some hardware failure(s) with the keyboard itself, since this is what a system reset does: it wipes out all incompatible or problematic software problems. In that case, you’ll need to reach out to Logitech support to see what more can be done.

---

## 2\. The entire keyboard doesn’t work

 If your Logitech K780 keyboard doesn’t work at all, not just certain keys, then please try the following troubleshooting process to see if it helps.

<a href="https://caperobbin.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006118/18460" target="_top" id="2006118"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18460-2006118" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2006118/18460" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2.1 Make sure your computer has Bluetooth capability

 Although it sounds a bit needless to say, we still have to stress that the Logitech K780 requires the Bluetooth feature on your computer to work wirelessly. So you should either have a built-in Bluetooth adapter for your computer or an external USB Bluetooth receiver or dongle for K780 to work.

 To make sure that you have Bluetooth capability on your computer, and that the Bluetooth feature still works fine, here’s what you can do:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key at the same time to open**Settings** .
2. Select**Bluetooth & devices** . Make sure that the Bluetooth toggle is set to**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-95.png)  

 If you don’t see a Bluetooth option here, you don’t have Bluetooth capability on your computer. To use Logitech K780, you will need an external Bluetooth adapter or receiver, which can be easily bought online.
3. Select**Add device** , and then**Bluetooth** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-96.png)
4. Pay extra attention to the status bar here: if you see the blue dots running, then your Bluetooth feature and its driver should be fine.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-98.png)

 When you’ve made sure that your Bluetooth capability and its driver are both working fine, but your Logitech K780 keyboard still doesn’t work, please move on.

### 2.2 Update Windows

 System updates from Windows usually help to stabilize and optimize the overall computer environment. So if your system isn’t updated regularly, there could be compatibility issues that can cause problems like the keyboard not working straight. To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-18.png)
2. Click**Check for updates** , and Windows will scan for any available updates.

3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Restart your computer for the update to take effect if needed.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

4. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll see**You’re up to date** like this.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2.3 Charge your keyboard or install a new battery

 If your Logitech K780 keyboard battery runs low, or your battery is too old to charge anymore, it won’t be connected to your computer successfully.

 To check the battery power left for your K780 keyboard, you can turn the keyboard off and then back on again with the ON/OFF switch on the bottom.

 If the LED indicator to the left of the ON/OFF switch is read, it means that you’ll need to change the keyboard batteries.

 Make sure that you’ve done the above, and try to connect your K780 keyboard to your computer via Bluetooth again. If Logitech K780 still doesn’t work, please move on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2.4 Make sure there’s no interference from other devices

 When the connection between your Logitech K780 and your computer is still lost, you’ll then need to make sure that there’s no interference from other devices like wireless speakers, PSU (power supply units), monitors, mobile phones, and/or garage door openers.

 These are the objects mentioned by Logitech that could potentially interfere with the use of Logitech K780 and therefore stop its connection to your computer, and thus with the keyboard not working problem.

 Also, please don’t use K780 on metal surfaces, and it could be another form of interference as well.

 When you’ve cleared out all the above objects from your K780, but it still doesn’t work, please move on.

---

### 2.5 Reconnect your keyboard

 If your Logitech K780 keyboard still refuses to work after all the above, you can try to force a new reconnection. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key at the same time to open**Settings** .
2. Select**Bluetooth & devices** . Make sure that the Bluetooth toggle is set to**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-95.png)
3. If you see your Logitech K780 keyboard here, click the**three-dot icon** and select**Remove device** .
