[Motherboard Chipset: What It Is and What to Look For](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-chipset-on-a-motherboard-5185658)

## What CPU Should a Motherboard Have?

 A CPU is a critical PC element that interprets and executes your hardware and software commands. If you're replacing or upgrading a motherboard, you can choose one that works with your existing CPU. But if you're buying a new CPU or building a PC, you'll also need a processor.

 A mid-tier CPU will be powerful enough for multitasking and smooth operations to ensure maximum productivity for your PC for business use. If you're a gamer, you'll want a CPU with higher clock speeds and extensive RAM support. If you're a content creator, you'll want a CPU with enough RAM to support 4K video.  

 Check your CPU specs carefully to determine if they suit your intended uses.

## What CPU Socket Should a Motherboard Have?

 The CPU socket is a critical factor when deciding what motherboard to buy. A motherboard's CPU socket type determines what CPUs you can use with the motherboard.

 If you have a computer and need to replace the motherboard due to component failure or to upgrade it, select one with a socket that fits your existing CPU. Or, you can buy a new CPU.

 If buying a new CPU replacement or building a new PC, determine what socket it fits after deciding on the CPU you want. For example, an Intel i7 Core i7-9700F processor requires a motherboard with support for the LGA 1151 socket, and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X needs a motherboard with support for the AM4 socket.

 To find out what socket you need, check your CPU's documentation or look it up on the CPU manufacturer's website. If you're shopping online, the socket is usually found somewhere on the listing for the CPU.

## What Form Factor and Case Should a Motherboard Have?

 Along with the CPU socket, a motherboard's form factor is one of the most critical elements to select.

 If you already have a computer and need to replace the motherboard to upgrade it or due to component failure, select a motherboard with a socket that will fit your existing CPU and fit in your current case unless you want to buy a new CPU and case.

 If you're building a new computer, select a motherboard that will accommodate the CPU you want and fit in your chosen case. When selecting a case, aesthetics plays a part, of course, but the more important consideration is the case's size and the type of motherboard it supports.

 Here are the main types of motherboard form factors you'll use when building a custom PC:

* **ATX** : This is the form factor used in most desktop computers. It's 12 inches long and 9.625 inches wide and offers room for expansion cards and peripherals.
* **Micro-ATX** : This is the same width as the ATX but two inches shorter. That means it fits smaller cases but doesn't have as much space for expansion slots.
* **Mini-ITX** : These motherboards are only 6.75 inches wide and 6.75 inches long, so they fit in small cases but don't have much space for expansion slots. You may get one expansion slot or none at all.

 Decide which case you want, and check if it's an ATX, Micro-ATX, or Mini-ITX case. You can look for a motherboard that matches the CPU socket you want to use.

[What Motherboard Do I Have? 4 Ways to Find Out](https://www.lifewire.com/identifying-a-motherboard-5072950)

 The form factor of the motherboard doesn't affect the type of CPU you need to use. If the motherboard has the correct socket, you can use the same CPU with an ATX, Micro-ATX, or Mini-ITX motherboard.

## What Expansion Ports Should a Motherboard Have?

 After the CPU socket and form factor, the next most important factor is how many expansion ports, usually[PCIe ports](https://www.lifewire.com/pci-express-pcie-2625962) , the motherboard has and how many you think you'll need.

 The two most common[expansion ports](https://www.lifewire.com/expansion-slot-2625870) to look for are PCIe x16 slots, which can accommodate graphics cards, and PCIe x1 slots, used for other expansion cards like adding extra USB ports. If you'd like to install two video cards, ensure the motherboard has two expansion ports that can accommodate video cards.

 Most motherboards support PCIe 3.0, but some support the newer PCIe 4.0 and 5.0, which provide more bandwidth. If you have any PCIe cards or want to future-proof your selection, look for a board with PCIe 5.0 support.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## What Built-In Ports Does a Motherboard Need?

 It’s also worth looking at the ports built into the motherboard. Motherboards will include a mix of[USB-A](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-type-a-connector-2626032) ,[USB-C](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490) , audio ports,[HDMI and DisplayPort](https://www.lifewire.com/displayport-vs-hdmi-4686971) , and even legacy ports like VGA, PS/2, parallel, and serial ports. Motherboards can also include Ethernet ports and other connectivity like built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

 Consider which ports you’re most likely to need, and select a motherboard that fits your requirements so you won’t have to add an expansion card or USB hub immediately.

## How Much RAM Does a Motherboard Need?

 It’s also important to look at how many[RAM](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) slots the motherboard has and how much total RAM it supports to meet your memory needs. This factor isn’t crucial if your computer only needs to stream media, surf the web, and play basic games. Still, having the option to install more RAM is vital if you do any video or photo editing or play resource-intensive games.

## What Is a Motherboard?

 A motherboard is a computer hardware element that connects various internal computer parts, including the CPU, memory modules, hard drives, expansion cards, and ports. Computer parts connect to the computer directly or with appropriate cables.

 Macs and Windows PCs have motherboards, but Mac motherboards are generally called "logic boards." When you hear the term "motherboard," it's likely a Windows PC component.

 A motherboard is like the backbone of a Windows PC, holding its elements together. It's one of your computer's most critical components because the rest is assembled around it. The CPU plugs into a special socket on the motherboard; expansion cards like your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) also plug into the motherboard, as does your[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and everything else.
