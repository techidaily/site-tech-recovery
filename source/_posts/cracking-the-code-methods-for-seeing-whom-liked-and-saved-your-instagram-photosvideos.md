## Cracking the Code: Methods for Seeing Whom Liked and Saved Your Instagram Photos/Videos

Close 

###  What to Know

* Instagram doesn't provide this information. Instead, ask your followers. Post a story or poll to see who saved your post.
* To see how many people saved the post, switch to a creator account and then select**View insights** under the post.

 This article explains how to see which users saved your post on Instagram and how many times it's been saved overall.

##  Ask Your Followers If They've Saved Your Posts 

 Unfortunately, Instagram doesn't provide this information. Regardless of your account type, the only way to see who has saved your posts is to start asking people. Here are some ideas:

1. [ Take a screenshot](https://www.lifewire.com/take-screenshot-on-any-device-5087162) of the post and then[ post a story](https://www.lifewire.com/post-a-story-on-instagram-5069910) using that screenshot. Add some text to let your followers know what you're asking about.
2. [ Make a poll](https://www.lifewire.com/make-instagram-poll-4582942) . Either ask about the post or screenshot it, then give**Yes** and**No** as the options and wait for the results.
3. [ Use the questions sticker](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-instagram-questions-sticker-4689053) . This sets up a template for asking the question.

##  How to See How Many Times an Instagram Post Has Been Saved 

 If you're less curious about who saved your post and instead want to see how many times it was saved, Instagram does let you do that. But it doesn't work from a personal account. First,[ switch your personal account to a creator account](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-instagram-creator-account-4777670) , and then follow these steps to see your stats:

1. Tap your**profile** image to open your profile.
2. Choose the**post** you want to view the save count for.
3. Tap**View insights** . Several stats appear; the bookmark icon refers to how many times someone has saved this particular post.

 Seeing who saves your posts on Instagram can be more important than tracking the number of likes because when someone adds your content to an[ Instagram collection](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-instagram-collections-4770093) , it means they like it enough to want to refer to it later. Short of asking your followers, however, there's no way to see who saved your Instagram posts or to what collections. The reason for this limitation is likely privacy.
