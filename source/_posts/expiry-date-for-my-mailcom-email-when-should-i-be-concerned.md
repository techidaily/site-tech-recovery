## The Ultimate Fix for When Your iPad Won't Pair with Wi-Fi at Home or Work
 When your iPad won't connect to the internet, you can't download apps, send and receive messages, or browse the web. Fortunately, most iPad Wi-Fi issues are easy to fix.

## Why Wi-Fi Is Not Working on iPad

 Wi-Fi problems are almost always related to the network password or distance from the router. Here's a list of common reasons the internet doesn't work on an iPad:

* Wi-Fi is turned off
* You're too far from the router
* The Wi-Fi password is wrong
* You haven't agreed to the network's terms
* The network is hidden
* The router needs a reboot
* Your ISP is having internet issues

 If none of your devices can reach the internet, then this problem isn't isolated to just your iPad. Learn[how to fix it when there's no internet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-to-do-when-theres-no-wi-fi-internet-connection-2378240) for some better solutions.

## How to Fix iPad Wi-Fi Not Working

 Most problems connecting to the internet can be fixed in a few easy steps. Work through these tips in the order we've listed them:

1. [Turn Wi-Fi on](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-ipad-to-wifi-steps-1999815) . It's important to check this first before moving on to these other steps. Go to**Settings** \>**Wi-Fi** and make sure the toggle is switched on and that the right network is chosen.
2. Get closer to the router. This is where the Wi-Fi network starts, so moving closer will increase the chances that the iPad can get a strong signal.  
 Be sure to complete this step if your[Wi-Fi network isn't an option when you're looking for one to connect to](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-wifi-network-not-showing-up-4628122) . If getting closer works, upgrading to a[router designed for long distances](https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554) could be smart.
3. [Restart the iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-off-every-ipad-model-1999824) . This basic troubleshooting step can cure all types of problems and should always be done before some of the more involved solutions.
4. [Turn Airplane Mode on and then off](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-iphone-airplane-mode-2000238) . We've seen this fix inexplicable network-related issues, and it only takes a few seconds to complete.  
 This is a toggle on your iPad that's easy to switch on by accident. When it's on, it disables Wi-Fi.
5. Forget the network and then reconnect to it. This is most useful if the password stored on your iPad is no longer correct, but it's worth a shot even if you're sure it's right.  
 Go to**Settings** \>**Wi-Fi** . Tap the**(i)** next to the Wi-Fi network and then tap**Forget This Network** \>**Forget** . Then, connect to the network again and supply the correct password to see if this fixes your iPad's Wi-Fi not working.
6. If the iPad won't connect to new Wi-Fi networks automatically, it might seem like the Wi-Fi is broken, but really it's just not prompting you to connect.  
 To fix this, go to**Settings** \>**Wi-Fi** \>**Ask to Join Networks** . Select**Notify** to be alerted when Wi-Fi is available.  
 The iPad will always connect to known networks, regardless of the option you pick here. However, choosing Notify is ideal if you frequently move between public networks and want to easily know when a new one is nearby.
7. Open Safari and agree to the network's terms. This is relevant when you connect your iPad to some[Wi-Fi hotspots](https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-hotspot-definition-2377357) .  
 The web page should open automatically. If you're on a hotel's Wi-Fi network, it's common to enter your last name and room number to validate that you're a guest but read the form to verify what information you need.
8. [Clear the browser cache](https://www.lifewire.com/clear-cache-on-ipad-5082550) . Safari and other browsers can stop working correctly when there's an issue with the app's cache. This isn't a Wi-Fi issue, exactly, but it can seem like one if you can't browse the web.
9. Are you joining a hidden network? If so, you won't see the Wi-Fi network in the list for you to select. From the**Wi-Fi** screen on your iPad, tap**Other** and then fill out the[SSID](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-service-set-identifier-816547) , security, and password information that corresponds to the hidden network.
10. Turn off**Private Wi-Fi Address** . Some routers aren't fully compatible with this setting, so disabling it can instantly fix Wi-Fi problems on iPad.  
 You can find this option in**Settings** \>**Wi-Fi** . Just tap the**(i)** next to the network you're trying to use, then tap the toggle to switch it off.
11. [Reset network settings](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-reset-network-settings-do-5184073) via**Settings** \>**General** \>**Transfer or Reset iPad** \>**Reset** \>**Reset Network Settings** .  
 This won't delete your apps and other files. However, it will erase any stored Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth devices, and[VPN](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-vpn-5189778) connections.
12. [Update iPadOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-ipad-6386217) . This is completely free to do and could be the fix for when iPad Wi-Fi doesn't work. If there's an update available, install it. If this is a known issue, Apple might have pushed out a fix for it.
13. [Restart the router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) . Many Wi-Fi problems originate from the router itself. Rebooting the network hardware won't permanently erase anything.

14. [Log in to the router](https://www.lifewire.com/accessing-your-router-at-home-818205) and change the Wi-Fi network so it broadcasts on the 2.4Ghz band instead of 5GHz. You might also try to weaken the encryption a bit (i.e., change it from[WPA3](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wpa3-wi-fi-4845626) to WPA2). If you have an older iPad, it might struggle to connect to a network that's using a newer frequency or encryption.

15. Contact your[ISP](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) . If your iPad can't get on Wi-Fi at this point, there could be a bigger, network-wide issue with your internet service provider.
