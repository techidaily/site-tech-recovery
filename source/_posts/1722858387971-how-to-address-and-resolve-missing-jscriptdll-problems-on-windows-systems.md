## xinput1_3.dll File Missing? Here's How You Can Resolve It
 Xinput1\_3.dll errors indicate a problem with Microsoft DirectX; the xinput1\_3[DLL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) file is contained in that software collection. These errors usually show up only when you run Windows-based games and advanced graphics programs. A system restart can often resolve the error. If that doesn't work, there are five other things you can try.

## How to Fix Xinput1\_3.dll Errors

 Do not download the xinput1\_3.dll DLL file individually from any "DLL download site."[Downloading DLLs from these sites is never a good idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already downloaded xinput1\_3.dll from one of those DLL download sites, remove it from wherever you put it and continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet.  
 The xinput1\_3.dll error might be a fluke and a simple restart could clear it up completely.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version of DirectX will fix the xinput1\_3.dll not found error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.  
 Windows 10, 8, 7, Vista, XP, etc. are all supported by this same DirectX installation package. It will install any DirectX 11, DirectX 10, or DirectX 9 file needed and supported in that version of Windows.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the xinput1\_3.dll error you're receiving, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD. Usually, if a game or another program uses DirectX, the software developers include a copy of DirectX on the installation disc.  
 Sometimes — though not often — the DirectX version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.
4. [Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something might have happened to the program files that work with xinput1\_3.dll, and a reinstall could do the trick.
5. [Restore the xinput1_3.dll file from the latest DirectX software package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your xinput1\_3.dll error, try extracting the xinput1\_3.dll individually from the DirectX downloadable package.
6. [Update the drivers for your video card](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . While it's not the most common solution, in some situations updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for the[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.
