 Today I will write something about how to remove DRM from epub Mac. Maybe you heve been hating reading books on Mac for a long time and want to free yourself to read the books on other protable devices. Here I will help you solve the problem. After you strip epub DRM Mac, you can read your epub books on any device which supports epub such as iPad, Kindle devices, Sony eReader ect. The decrypted epub books will no longer be restricted only to your Mac or certain platforms. Then you can enjoy them freely.

### Remove DRM from Adobe EPUB Mac

Most of the epub books purchaesd from the mainsrteam ebook stores like Google, Nook, Sony, Kobo ect. are in Adobe (Adept) DRM. Then how to remove DRM from Adobe epub on your Mac? Continue to read the detailed steps.

1Make sure you can read the epub books normally on Adobe Digital Editions.

First download and install [Adobe Digital Editions for Mac.](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html) Authorize your computer with an Adobe ID. Then open the epub ebooks on your computer with Adobe Digital Editions. If the ebooks can be read normally, then their DRM can be removed with DRM removal later. So just make sure that you can read the epub files normally on Adobe Digital Editions at this step.

2Remove DRM from Adobe EPUB Mac.

To remove Adobe DRM from epub books, you need a DRM removal. Here I recommend [Adobe EPUB DRM Removal for Mac--Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). It can help you remove Adobe DRM from your epub files quickly and easily. 

First download and install Adobe EPUB DRM Removal. You can use this software for free.

Download the tool for free:

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) 

Then double click to open the ePUB DRM Removal--Epubor Ultimate. It will load the Adobe DRM ebooks under the ADE default folder "My Digital Editions" automatically. Then you can just drag and drop the books under "Adobe" tab in the left column to the right to get them decrypted.

Click "Decrypted", you will open the folder storing the decrypted adobe epub files.

**Pro tips -- open acsm with ADE:**

If you have acsm files, you can double-click the .acsm file, then it will be opened with Adobe Digital Editions as default to download the corresponding real epub book for you. But if your .acsm file is not opened with ADE as default, you can right click the file and choose"Open with" -> "Adobe Digital Editions". After the downloading is finished, then you can continue to remove DRM from them. 

If you have other Adobe DRM epub books that are not under the default folder "My Digital Editions", you can directly drag and drop the books to the software interface. (Before this, you should also make sure you can open them on ADE). As soon as you drag them to the software, their DRM will be removed immediately.

### Remove DRM from iBooks EPUB Mac

Then for the DRM epub books purchased from iTunes, they are in iBooks DRM (Apple FairPlay DRM). So to remove iBooks DRM, we use the iBooks DRM removal. 

1Download and install[iBooks DRM removal.](http://download.epubor.com/sold/ibooksdrmremoval/requiem-4.1-mac.zip)

2Remove DRM from iBooks EPUB Mac.

Now double-click on the removal to get it run on your Mac. Then it will automatically find and load your DRMed epub books from the iTunes library and remove DRM from them.

If you don't want it to bahave like this, you can press "shift" when opening the software. You then drag & drop the DRMed epub books to the software window. The books will be decrypted in seconds. Next you will get the DRM-free epub books to read.

![ibooks drm removal](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ibooks-drm-removal.png)

The decrypted epub books will replace the original files automatically. If you still have a need of the DRM epub books, you can go to check the “Recycle Bin”. Or you can back-up the original books before removing DRM.
