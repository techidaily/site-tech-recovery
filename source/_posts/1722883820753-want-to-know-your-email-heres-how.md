## Lost Track of Your Email? Here's How You Can Find It
 What's my email? The steps you take to find out what email address people see when you email them depend on the service or email program you use. Below are general instructions as well as specific instructions for[popular email providers](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-email-accounts-1356641) .

## General Instructions for Finding Your Email Address

 The easiest way to identify your email address in almost any desktop program or online email client is to start writing a new message. Here's how:

1. Start a new email message. This usually works by selecting a Compose, New, or Write button.  
![Write button in Thunderbird to create a new email](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vfi5wXvY3RcT222hngh898Ip2Nc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_what-is-my-email-address-00513893073547b297e3c0a404898612.jpg)
2. Look for a line that begins with**From** . It contains your email address.  
![From field in Thunderbird on macOS](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U286s-oO_Fk2Ih1u8Rl4JwZ94nQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/002_what-is-my-email-address-5ac0b8ce371249c3a9b9c65b9aa9a778.jpg)
3. If you have more than one email address configured for sending, they usually show up as menu choices in the**From** line when you compose an email. All the email addresses listed are yours. You can use any of them.

 Need to find your old email address? Some[people finder tools](https://www.lifewire.com/search-engines-that-top-the-web-3482269) can dig up that information.

## Use an Echo Service to See Your Email Address

 An echo service is another way to see what email address you're using. This method is typically used to[test whether your email is working properly](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-test-your-email-address-1171119) , but as an added bonus, part of the response you receive includes your email address. Here's how this works:

1. Compose a new email and enter**<echo@univie.ac.at>** in the**To** field. No subject line or message is necessary.  
![echo@univie.ac.at written in the To field on Gmail](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GbiaW6sWyAx6xEocHTKbiUO_u3M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/echo-service-email-address-cc85da0c64e2479597ca3526c779ae58.png)
2. Select**Send** .
3. Wait for the automated response. The recipient line says**Echo** and the subject line says**Automatic Response from <echo@univie.ac.at>** .
4. Open the email and scroll down a bit until you see the**Received** section. In there is a line like this that shows your email address:  
 `(envelope-from <youremail@example.com>)`  
![The envelope-from line of an email from an echo service](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gCh4kvgz6_QI92rzFbzHe4sLj5o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/gmail-echo-service-214a8fb2631d4aed8f480e8d6135d44f.png)

 Other methods can be used to find your email but they vary depending on the service you use.
