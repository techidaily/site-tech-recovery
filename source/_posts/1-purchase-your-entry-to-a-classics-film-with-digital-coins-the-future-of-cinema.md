## 1. Purchase Your Entry to a Classics Film with Digital Coins: The Future of Cinema

[Cryptocurrency](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-11-free-apps-to-check-imei-on-itel-p40plus-phones-by-drfone-android/) is generally talked about as an investment, but let's not forget that it's a form of currency that can be used to pay for things. Now, AMC, rulers of the meme stock,Â has started accepting various currencies on [its website](https://www.amctheatres.com/), so you can pay for a movie with crypto.

 Currently, you can use Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin to pay for movie tickets on AMC's website. AccordingÂ to a [tweet from AMC CEO Adam Aron](https://twitter.com/CEOAdam/status/1458974884609019916?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1458974884609019916%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F12%2F22779137%2Famc-theaters-movie-tickets-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-cash-ethereum-litecoin), the company also plans to accept Dogecoin next.

 While it's not confirmed,Â Aron specifically calls out online purchases with crypto, so it doesn't appear that you'll be able to walk into your local movie theater and pay for a film with crypto. Instead, you'll need to purchase tickets in advance if you want to spend your Bitcoin and other currencies. While that makes it a bit less exciting, it's still a terrific way to use your money if you don't want to sit on it.

 Aron's tweet also mentions that the new online payment methods "already account for 14 percent of our total online transactions." However, he also mentioned acceptingÂ [Apple Pay](https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/efficient-techniques-for-accessing-and-saving-vimeo-videos/), Google Pay, and PayPal, so it appears those are included in that number. That makes it unclear how popular paying for movies with crypto actually is, but we'd expect the number of people using it is pretty low.
