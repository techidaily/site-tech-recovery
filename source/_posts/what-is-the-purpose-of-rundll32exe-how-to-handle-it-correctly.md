![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59ba2cbe02f23.png)

_Skype can’t connect_

 Skype sure is making our lives so much easier. But there are times when you can’t connect to Skype, and you’re seeing the message saying**_Sorry, we couldn’t connect to Skype_** , you’re not alone. Many Windows 10 users are reporting this problem as well. But no worries, it’s possible to fix.

 Here are 4 fixes for you to try. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down until you find the one works for you.

 **Method 1:[Check Skype Heartbeat](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 2:[Upgrade Skype to the latest version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 3:[Check for Available Windows Update](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 4:[Refresh Network Settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
 **Method 5:[Update Network Card Driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Check Skype Heartbeat

 If Skype is suddenly down, most of the case, the problem is not on your side. It could be Skype that is having issues. You can check Skype’s status by:

 1) Open Skype. Click**Help** , then**Heartbeat** .

 3) If you do see message concerning connection problem, all you can do is to wait for Skype technicians to solve it on their end.

## 2\. Upgrade Skype to the latest version

 If you don’t see error message on Skype Heartbeat, then it’s time for you to upgrade your Skype.

 1) Open Skype. Click**Help** and then**Check for updates** .

 3) You can also go the the official website of Skype to download the latest version from there.

##

4) You may need to restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

5) See if your Skype is connecting now.

##

 **4\. Refresh Network Settings**

 2) Type the following commands. Make sure that you have made no typo and then press the**Enter** key on your keyboard after each command.

ipconfig /release;
ipconfig /renew;
netsh winsock reset;
netsh int ip reset;
ipconfig /flushdns;
ipconfig /registerdns;
