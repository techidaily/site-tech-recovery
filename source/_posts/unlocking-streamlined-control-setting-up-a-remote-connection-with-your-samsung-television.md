4. Above the bottom bar, you'll see a series of icons showing the TV inputs. Select**Remote Access** .
5. Choose**Remote PC** .
6. You'll see a large window labeled**Connect to Remote PC** . You're asked to enter your PC's credentials. To create a new PC profile, select the**User** **icon** located to the right of the PC/Profile box to launch the**User Profiles** window.
