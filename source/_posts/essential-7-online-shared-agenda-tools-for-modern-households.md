## Create and Send a Voice Message With Messages

 Typing text messages can be time-consuming if you have a lot to say. By sending a voice message in[the Messages app](https://www.lifewire.com/imessage-apples-free-texting-app-1999185) , you can say exactly what you want to your recipient.

 These instructions apply to iPhones running iOS 16 and later. We've noted any differences between versions.

1. Open the conversation you want to send a voice message in, or start a new one.

### Drawbacks of Using Messages

 Here are a couple of disadvantages to using this function in Messages:

* As an iPhone user, you cannot currently send voice messages using the Messages app to other smartphones like Android.
* By default, audio messages expire two minutes after you listen to them and are automatically removed. Your recipient can tap**Keep** to hold onto your message or disable the expiration by going to**Settings** \>**Messages** .

 If your recipient isn’t an iPhone user or you want to avoid the possible expiration of your audio message, consider sharing your message using Voice Memos.

## Create and Send a Voice Message With Voice Memos

 The[Voice Memos app](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-voice-memos-on-iphone-4799058) is excellent for capturing audio notes, speakers during a meeting, and more. Since you can easily share a voice recording from the app, this is a solid alternative to the Messages app on iPhone.

1. Open Voice Memos on your iPhone and tap (don’t hold) the red **Record** button at the bottom.
2. Speak your message. You’ll see the duration of the recording as you speak.
3. When you finish with your message, tap the red **Stop** button.

4. The recording pops to the top section of the screen. You can tap the **Play** button to have a listen.  
 To share, tap the**three dots** next to the name of the recording.  

### Tip  

 If you want to rename the recording before you share it, tap the current title and type in the new one.
5. Select **Share** .
6. Choose a sharing option from the Share Sheet. Depending on your iPhone's sharing options, you can send the audio message in a text message, email, or shared storage service like Dropbox.
