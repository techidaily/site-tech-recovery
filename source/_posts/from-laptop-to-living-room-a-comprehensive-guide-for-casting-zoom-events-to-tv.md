Alternatively, maybe you just want to[export your Yahoo Mail contacts](https://www.lifewire.com/export-yahoo-address-book-1174479) so you can import them into a[different email service](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-email-accounts-1356641) .

 In some cases,[Yahoo won't remove everything for up to 180 days](https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/datastorage/index.html) , but that depends largely on the country you signed up from. Data connected to paid Fantasy Sports products might be kept even longer.

## What Does It Mean to Delete a Yahoo Mail Account?

 Deleting Yahoo Mail is only possible if you delete the whole Yahoo account. This means, of course, that your emails will get removed, but you'll also lose access to your [My Yahoo](https://my.yahoo.com/) settings, calendars, Yahoo Fantasy teams, Yahoo Finance portfolios, and any other data stored in Yahoo's services.  

 Although it used to be the case, you will not delete your Flickr account if you delete your Yahoo account. This is true, however, only if you've upgraded to the latest login system. If you haven't, or you're not sure,[contact Flickr to ask about this](https://www.flickrhelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) .

 Here are some important things to be aware of when it comes to deleting your Yahoo account:

* **What will happen to my Yahoo Mail email address?**  Your username and email address will be available for others to use in the future, so they might receive messages meant for you if senders still use your old email address.
* **Can I reactivate a closed Yahoo Mail account?**  Yes, you can reactivate your account even after you've marked it for deletion. To reopen a deleted Yahoo account, log in within 30 days of deleting it. You can do this through the regular[Yahoo Mail](https://mail.yahoo.com/) web page. Once you've reactivated the account, you can start getting emails but you will not see messages that were sent to the account while it was closed.
* **What happens to emails sent to my address after I close my Yahoo Mail account?**  In the meantime (starting as soon as you close your account), senders trying to message your deleted Yahoo Mail account's address will receive a delivery failure message.

 Once you close your Yahoo Mail account, anyone who tries to send a message to your email address will immediately receive a delivery failure message. Also, any online accounts that are using your Yahoo email as the recovery address will no longer be able to send you recovery information.

 To avoid confusion and concern, tell your contacts you are about to close your Yahoo account â€” both from the email address you plan to use in the future (so they can easily reply to reach you) and from your Yahoo Mail account (to ensure delivery).

 FAQ

* How do you change your Yahoo Mail password?  
 To[change your password](https://www.lifewire.com/change-yahoo-password-1174508) , log in to Yahoo Mail and select your profile image at the top right. Go to**Manage your account** \>**Security** \>**Change password** .
* How do you block unwanted senders in Yahoo Mail?  
 To[block mail from unwanted senders](https://www.lifewire.com/block-sender-yahoo-1174455) , log in to Yahoo Mail and go to**Settings** \>**More Settings** . In the**Security & privacy** section, select**Add** under**Blocked addresses** . Type the sender's address in the box and press**Save** .
* How do you add a contact in Yahoo Mail?  
 To automatically[add someone as a contact](https://www.lifewire.com/auto-add-contacts-yahoo-1174459) when they email you, log in to Yahoo Mail and open**Settings** \>**More Settings** . Select**Contacts** \>**Enable** .
