## What Is Amazon Prime Day?

 Amazon created Amazon Prime Day to celebrate those who subscribe to the Amazon Prime service. They pay a yearly premium for things like free two-day shipping, streaming movies on[Prime Video](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-video-4176363) , songs in[Amazon Music](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-music-unlimited-and-amazon-prime-music-compared-4160098) , books and magazines in[Prime Reading](https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-prime-reading-4160132) , and additional features to make[membership worth the price](https://www.lifewire.com/is-amazon-prime-worth-it-8536157) .

 To show its appreciation to members, Amazon offers deep discounts and superb deals on products specifically for its Prime members on Amazon Prime Day.

 Yes, you must be an Amazon Prime member to participate in the deals on Prime Day. If you’re not a Prime member, you can still purchase items, but not at the discounted prices.

## A Quick Glance at Prime Day History

 Amazon introduced Prime Day on July 15, 2015 in honor of its 20th birthday. Since then, it has become a yearly event that takes place in July.

 One exception was in 2020, when Amazon shifted the event to October in 19 countries due to the COVID pandemic.  
  
 If the previous years are an indication, Amazon Prime Day begins on the second Tuesday in July. However, this isn’t a guarantee; it's just a pattern of past Prime Day events.

## How Long Does It Last?

 In its first two years, 2015 and 2016, Amazon Prime Day lasted just one day. Beginning in 2017, Amazon extended the deals to cover two full days, and it has remained that way since, although the name, "Amazon Prime_Day_ ," hasn’t changed.  
  
 The event usually starts at 12:00 a.m. PDT (3:00 a.m. EDT) on the first day and ends at 11:59 p.m. PDT on the second, giving you a full 48 hours of shopping time.

## When Is the Next Amazon Prime Day?

 In 2024, Prime Days will be held July 15 and 16.

 Normally held in July, Amazon selects the exact days for Amazon Prime Day only about a month or two ahead of time. So, you’ll have to be on the lookout for the current year’s dates, and luckily, you have a few handy ways to do so.

* **Check your email** : If you receive email notifications as a Prime member, check your inbox for the dates as the event grows closer.
* **Visit the Prime Day website** : You can visit the dedicated[Prime Day website](https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8649007%7Cn4c428fad6afd4614a500820e249a31c822%7C) for news on the event dates.
* **Ask Alexa** : For a hands-free way to stay in-the-know, you can also ask Alexa, “When is Amazon Prime Day?”

### Tip

 You can set a reminder with Alexa for the event. Just say, “Remind me when Prime Day starts.”

## What's on Sale?

 Along with the dates for Amazon Prime Day each year, Amazon keeps the deals you can expect a bit of a secret. If you do some searching, you may be able to find sneak peeks of the discounts as the event grows nearer.

 Generally, you’ll find lower prices on tech products and electronics, apparel, toys, appliances, houseware, and much more. So, you may see discounts on products from name brands like Bissell, iRobot, and Sony.

 Over the years, you could find discounts on Alexa-enabled devices like the Fire TV Stick and Echo Dot, kitchen brands like Rachael Ray and Keurig, toys from VTech and LeapFrog, and apparel and accessories by Levi’s.

 But it’s not all about big-ticket items on Amazon Prime Day. There’ve also been deals on pet products, health and beauty supplies, and–just in time for back-to-school–merchandise like notebooks and calculators.

## How to Know What’s on Sale During Prime Day

 Even though you have 48 hours to shop Amazon Prime Day, you might miss a terrific price on a product you want. While you can subscribe to the Amazon newsletter, there are a few additional ways to stay updated on deals and discounts.

![Amazon Deals web page](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/ERTGrTao-zDmsQskJ4PB92V-XFA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amazon-Deals-Website-8649007-aa50ccf8802040c683938aac2a330c85.jpeg)

* **Use the Amazon Shopping mobile app** : There’s no better way to keep abreast of Amazon’s deals than with your mobile device. You can check out the Prime Day deals in the Amazon Shopping app on both Android and iPhone. You also have the option to create Deal Alerts.
* **Head to the Prime Day website** : Along with news on the event dates, you’ll see the deals you can expect on Amazon’s Prime Day web page.
* **Visit the Amazon Deals web page** : In addition to the official Prime Day website, you can check and even bookmark the[Amazon Deals page](https://www.amazon.com/deals?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=8649007%7Cn4c428fad6afd4614a500820e249a31c822%7C) , where you’ll find the specials for the event.
* **Get help from Alexa** : Not only can Alexa fill you in on dates for Prime Day, but it can also let you know when a product you want goes on sale. Add an item to your Wish List, Amazon Cart, or Saved for Later list, and ask Alexa to let you know about the deal when it’s time.

 Now that you know the ins and outs of Amazon Prime Day, be sure to pencil it in on your calendar, bookmark the Amazon website, download the mobile app, and get ready to shop.
