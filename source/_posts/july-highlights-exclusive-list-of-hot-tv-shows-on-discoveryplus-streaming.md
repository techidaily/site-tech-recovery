 Chicks and Bunnies is a super cute theme that boasts 14 high-quality photos of baby rabbits and chickens. These adorable photos make this theme perfect for those looking to get into the Easter spirit. The only downside of this theme is its default fluorescent green which is incredibly jarring and makes it impossible to see which apps are open in the taskbar. Fortunately, this color can be changed in the theme’s settings.

 What We Like

* Good mix of Halloween and autumn imagery.
* 13 images to choose from in the theme.

 What We Don't Like

* Some images look a bit blurry on high res monitors.

 Pumpkin Season is a Microsoft-made desktop theme that’s all about Halloween, autumn, and everything in between. The 13 photos in this theme feature everything one would expect from Jack-o-lanterns and candy to autumn leaves and pumpkin seeds. All of these images do have a high resolution but they aren’t 4K which means that some look a little blurry on high-end Windows devices such as Microsoft’s line of Surface computers and tablets. This minor issue will likely only bother those with an eye for resolution though such as photographers and designers.

 What We Like

* Good combo of Christmas food and decoration images.

 What We Don't Like

* The orange system color is an odd choice.

 Winter Holiday Glow is a theme that features nine Christmasy images. The high-resolution photos range from festive cookies and lights to pinecones in the snow and cinnamon sticks. The choice of orange as the system color is strange but this can be changed within the theme settings.
