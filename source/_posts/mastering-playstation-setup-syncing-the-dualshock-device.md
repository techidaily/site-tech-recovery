##  How to Sync a PS4 Controller to a PS4 

 To sync a controller with the system, especially for the first time, you'll need a USB cable; any[ USB 2.0](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-usb-2-0-2626037) Micro-B cable can connect the DualShock 4 to the console, and although there are only two USB ports on the system, you can sync up to four controllers per player account.

2. Turn on your PS4 by pressing the console's power button. It should automatically detect your connected controller and assign it to the first available player slot.

##  How to Charge Your PS4 Controller 

 The controller’s internal battery will charge while it is connected to the PS4\. If the controller remains connected while your PS4 is in rest mode, it will continue charging, and the light on top will turn yellow.

 The light will also flash yellow when your controller is running low on power, and you should see an on-screen message telling you to plug it in.

 When charged, the light bar on the top of the controller will glow different colors depending on which player the controller is assigned to; player 1 is blue, player 2 is red, player 3 is green, and player 4 is pink.

##  Troubleshooting: PS4 Wireless Connectivity Problems 

 If your controller won’t turn on when you press the PS button, plug it into the PS4 to make sure it has a charge. If the light bar doesn't glow, it could be a problem with your USB cable, or the controller's internal battery could be damaged. If you have an extra cable handy, try using that instead to eliminate the first possibility.

 If the controller can't connect to the console wirelessly even though it is charged, then the problem lies with either your console or your controller's Bluetooth connectivity.

 If your other PS4 controllers are working wirelessly, the faulty controller is to blame. Nonetheless, you can continue playing with the controller connected to the console via a USB.

 If you're unable to pair a PS4 controller with your console,[ try resetting it](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-ps4-controller-4174025) .
