Kindle Fire is based on Android OS but it doesn't look like an Android tablet. That's because Amazon has made many modifications on the original Android OS. In fact, these "modifications" are more than limitations. That's why I want to turn my kindle fire into Android tablet. If you are looking for the easiest way to turn kindle fire into Android table, you should not miss out this article.

Once talking about this issue, some people may think about flashing in a third party ROM such as the famous CyanogenMod ROM. Well this is an absolutely ultimate method but it's difficult to operate for many users. It's more than a technical work and you may get your Kindle Fire bricked – a terrible situation in which you can't do anything for the Kindle Fire. So I come up with another safe and easy way of turning Kindle Fire into Android tablet – installing an Android launcher! With this method, you can experience most Android features and can shift to original Amazon launcher freely. Now just follow the tutorial below and make your Kindle Fire an Android tablet.

### 1\. Install GO Launcher EX

GO Launcher EX is an artistic and effective Android launcher. It provides many custom options to allow you to make your own tablet. [Click here](https://go-launcher-ex.en.uptodown.com/android/download) to download GO Launcher EX and then install it on your Kindle Fire (via ES File Explorer).

![download-go-launcher](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/1-download-go-launcher.jpg)

### 2\. Run GO Launcher EX

After you install GO Launcher EX, Go to "Apps" and open the launcher. Skip all the welcome note and then tap the home icon at the bottom left corner of the screen and you will meet a notice like this:

![set-default-launcher](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/2-set-default-launcher.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Pitch on "Use by default for this action" and choose "GO Launcher EX". You'll get into the GO Launcher EX setting interface. Just skip the greetings and then the Kindle Fire will turn back to the new home screen. You can see your Kindle Fire has turned into Android tablet!

![turn-kindle-fire-into-android-tablet](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/3-home-screen.jpg)

### 3\. How to use GO Launcher EX

1 Shift from original launcher and Go Launcher

Tap the app icon and you can see all the apps. Slide to browse more apps. The original apps like Amazon Kindle, Amazon Shop and Amazon Appstore are now separated out and each of them has an icon like the picture shows. It must point out that the Amazon Kindle, which we use to read e-books, can't open in the GO Launcher EX. Once you tap the Amazon Kindle icon, it just has no response and the Kindle Fire get stuck unless you tap the home screen icon. This is a big pity but other Amazon apps can run smoothly. If you want to read e-books, just tap the "Kindle Launcher" to turn back into the original Amazon launcher. Or you can install a third party e-book reader. Perhaps this is the main defects of a third party launcher (I've tried other launchers and the Amazon Kindle remains not responding).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Every time you want to experience the GO Launcher EX again, just choose GO Launcher EX from the "Apps" or tap the home screen.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2 Manage apps

You can easily order the apps as you wish. Just hold any app, you'll see all the app icons are swaying. Hold the app and drag it to anywhere you want on the screen. You can also drag it to the main home screen, not just in the app list only.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Tap the top right of the screen and call out the management menu. You can manage the apps in various methods.

![manage-apps](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/8-manage-apps.jpg)

3 Check process

Kindle Fire doesn't support multitasking – you can't see the running process, let alone close the process or shift from another process. But with GO Launcher EX, multitasking comes true. Tap the "Running" icon on the top left of the screen and you can see all the process running at present. The right side is the RAM condition. If you find your Kindle Fire very slow, just hold the app and tap the red icon to close the process then the memory will be released.

![check-running-processes](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/9-check-running-processes.jpg)

The contents above are the 6 tips for you to increase Kindle Fire battery life. I hope these would help you.

4 Change wallpaper

Although the GO Launcher provides wallpaper options, you can't replace the wallpaper indeed. In fact, all third party launchers can't do this job on Kindle Fire. This is because Amazon has made some limitations. If you want to change the wallpaper, you must root your Kindle Fire first. For more details, please refer to this article: [How to change Kindle Fire wallpaper.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

![change-wallpaper](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/10-change-wallpaper.jpg)

These are the basic tips of using GO Launcher EX on Kindle Fire. Although it has some bugs like you can't open Amazon Kindle or change wallpaper, it provides most Android features that you can experience them in a simple way.

Hi,John.  
 Do you mean you dont't get the "COmplete action using " notice? You can choose "open" when you just installed this launcher or you can go to "Apps" to open the GO Launcher EX. Skip the welcome note and the Kindle Fire will get a new hime screen - that means the GO Launcher works. At this time when you tap the home button, the "Complete action using" box should appear and you need to choose "GO Launcher EX" and "Use by default for this action".

I've tried this on Amazon Kindle Fire 2nd gen. and it didn't work.   
 I've installed ES File Explorer, then copied the GO Launcher apk to the Kindle storage, then installed the latter through the ES, but it did not appear in the App list.   
 I can't find it anywhere in the menu although the installation was successful.

Does this method work with Kindle Fire HD 7" (before new Oct 2013 release)? 

 I've wanted to turn my Kindle into a full Android. I've already rooted and have Google Play. The app updates are still showing for the Amazon and not Google. Other than that, It's easy-peasy.

 Otherwise, fairly good instructions. Even with problems in the last step, I have Android and Amazon apps!

I closed my Amazon account and can not log in to access any I/O functionality at all. If I unlock the Kindle Fire, it only gives me a pop up saying there's a problem with my account and I can exit Amazon or get help. Well "get help" means setting Amazon back up, and Exit Amazon only sends me back to screen lock mode. There is no interface for any other kind of I/O. Other than activating my account, I don't know how to get past this lockout, I'm hoping someone can figure out how to install an OS that I am automatically a super-user and have root command access. (SUDO) In other words, I want to overwrite the current OS and install Linux. Android, I'm told, is based on Linux, but you are NOT able to access root commands BY DEFAULT.
