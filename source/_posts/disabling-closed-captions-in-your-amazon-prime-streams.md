## Slash Your Spending: 6 Unbeatable Online Deal Destinations Revealed
 Coupon websites have codes you can use to save money while shopping online. Many shopping websites accept coupon codes, but locating them can be tricky without a coupon finder.

 Below are coupon websites we love to use that offer updated, legit codes that you can use to save money instantly. All you have to do is enter the promo code at checkout to apply the discount.  

 Some coupons apply to all products on a website or[shopping app](https://www.lifewire.com/best-mobile-shopping-apps-2378006) , but others are for specific items only or require a minimum purchase before the discount is applied. For example, an Amazon coupon code might apply only to air fryers, while one for Pizza Hut could be 20 percent off anything they offer.

![Walmart promo codes and coupons at CouponCabin](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/G9ZjTpXWfj0k1605jT9Q7Bm-Ujg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/couponcabin-promo-codes-23b49406fd534bc2b3c901c1f6ddf691.png)

 What We Like

* Multiple ways to save money.
* Well-organized website.
* Dozens of categories to browse.
* Clearly shows coupon expiration dates.

 What We Don't Like

* User account required for some products.

* Busy, distracting website.

 CouponCabin is an excellent source for free coupon codes that work on hundreds of websites. Office Depot, Nike, Walmart, Hotels.com, eBay, Hobby Lobby, Old Navy, Nordstrom, Amazon, and Kohl's are just a few examples.

 The website couldn't be easier to use: search for a store or use the link below to select it from the list and then, from the store page, filter the results to see only coupon codes or offers that are expiring soon, free offers, deals under a specific product category, and details on how to get free shipping. This promo code site also supports in-store coupons.

 The[CouponCabin Sidekick browser extension](https://www.couponcabin.com/benefits/sidekick/) can apply any relevant codes for you automatically and handle all your cash-back offers. There's also a mobile app for Android and iOS.

## [Slickdeals](https://slickdeals.net/)

![Amazon promo codes at Slickdeals](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/V4DoGmMkVE0Qhm35KTQbkwT2K8I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/slickdeals-amazon-coupons-8889e08c2a204866b89540e79301d158.png)

 What We Like

* Tons of filtering options.
* Super-specific email alerts.
* Shows deals that have been verified.
* Continuously updated all day.
* Many deals don't require a code.

 What We Don't Like

* Several ads.
* Overwhelming amount of information.
* Cluttered pages.

 Slickdeals is a community-driven deals site, posting dozens of fantastic deals, coupons, and other goodies throughout the day. Thousands of store coupons can be found here.

 One of the best reasons to use this site as a coupon finder is its various ways to stay updated on new deals:[the forums](https://slickdeals.net/forums/) (these are_very_ active) and the detailed[Deal Alerts](https://slickdeals.net/deal-alerts/) you can create are just a couple of examples. There are also convenient RSS feeds for most topics, so you never miss a deal in your area of interest.

 This coupon code site can get pretty cluttered, so if you're unsure where to begin, try the[Popular Deals](https://slickdeals.net/deals/) page or[pick a category first](https://slickdeals.net/deal-categories/) , like grocery, finance, movies, or clothing.

 There's a mobile website and app to apply coupon codes from your phone. Desktop users can also benefit from the[Slickdeals Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/slickdeals-automatic-coup/jpdapbcmfllbpojmkefcikllfeoahglb) to avoid having to hunt down codes.

 What We Like

 This well-organized website lets you search for stores, browse by department, find coupon codes for popular stores, and more. There's also a whole section of the site just for cash-back offers if you prefer to save money that way.

 These codes are available from their website, the[RetailMeNot Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/retailmenot-deal-finder%EF%B8%8F/jjfblogammkiefalfpafidabbnamoknm) , and the mobile app.

 What We Like

* Easy-to-navigate website.
* Maintains a list of the top online coupons.
* Provides expiration dates.
* Printable and online promo codes.

 What We Don't Like

* Lots of pop-up windows.
* The retailer site doesn't always open due to too many redirects.
* Some coupons require extra steps, like creating an account.

 The name gives it away! Coupons.com has coupons, both for online and offline use. You can browse by popular stores or the top coupons.

 You don't need a user account for more of these coupons. Find the store you're shopping at, filter by online coupons, and select the link to view the promo code. Some codes, however, can only be seen after you sign up for an account, and others are available only via email.

 There's a free shipping filter and one for promo codes nearing their expiration. Otherwise, this site is pretty basic.

## [DealsPlus](https://www.dealsplus.com/coupons)

![A list of coupons and cash-back deals at DealsPlus](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TI7-4f3AphnfYb3wszBXqL3RsBo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dealsplus-a41e519f80ed4d729304618f05a94c75.png)

 What We Like

* Some discounts are applied via cashback.
* No website ads.
* Large list of supported stores.
* Several unique categories to browse, like luggage, supplies, and toys.

 What We Don't Like

* Clicking some links opens strange half-pages or closes the page.
* Several broken links.
* Long approval times for cashback deals.

 Another good coupon site is DealsPlus. We wouldn't pick it before the others on this list, but we still include it because it has a decent rewards program if you pick cashback offers. Plus, it supports lots of stores and has some advantages over the competition, like no website ads and easy access to related coupons.

 Many of the coupons here have no expiration. Most of the time, you're told before you click the promo code link what the deal applies to. Comments left on the coupons help to verify whether they're legit or not.

 This promo code website works on a phone through the app and on a computer from the website or[DealsPlus Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dealsplus-cashback-coupon/olplonfdcekbkpjnoeecfihlkfdkehbj) .
