 If you're running macOS Catalina (10.15) and newer, use Logitech Options or Logitech Options+ to add and remove unifying devices.
2. Remove any Logitech Unifying Receiver currently connected to your PC.
3. Launch the Logitech Unifying app.
4. A welcome screen will appear. Tap**Next** .
5. The installer will prompt you to connect a Logitech Unifying Receiver to your computer. Connect it to an open USB port. Tap**Next** .

 FAQ

* How do I replace the receiver for a wireless mouse?  
 If you lost your Logitech wireless mouse's Unifying USB receiver, you can buy a replacement receiver on the Logitech website or Amazon.
* How do I connect a Logitech wireless mouse without a receiver?  
 If your Logitech wireless mouse supports Bluetooth, you can connect it via Bluetooth instead of a receiver. To do this on a Windows 10 PC, go to**Settings** \>**Devices** \>**Add Bluetooth** . On your mouse, press the**Connect** button; the device should appear as an available Bluetooth device on your screen. Select it to complete the pairing process and use your mouse.
* Can I fix my Logitech wireless mouse receiver?  
 Possibly. First,[ update your Unifying Receiver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-logitech-unifying-receiver-4768666) if necessary. Then try uninstalling and reinstalling the software, then sync your mouse to the receiver. Check if you have the correct USB drivers installed on your PC. Search for the**USB.inf** and**USB.PNF** files. Uninstall any applications interfering with your receiver, such as software used to connect gaming controllers.

 Wireless Logitech mice and keyboards that connect to a Unifying Receiver can't connect to other receivers, including those made by Logitech. However, some wireless devices compatible with the Unifying Receiver also support Bluetooth.
