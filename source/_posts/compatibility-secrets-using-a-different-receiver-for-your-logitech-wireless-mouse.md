##  How to Sync a Logitech Wireless Mouse With a Different Receiver

 You can use any wireless Logitech mouse that supports the Unifying Receiver with any Unifying Receiver. A single Unifying Receiver can connect up to six wireless Logitech devices, including mice and keyboards.

 Most wireless Logitech mice connect through a USB dongle called the_Logitech Unifying Receiver_ . Your mouse will ship with a receiver, but you can sync the mouse to a different receiver if you lose it.

1. [ Download Logitech's Unifying software](https://support.logi.com/hc/articles/360025297913) . It's available for Windows 11, 10, 8, and 7, macOS 10.13 and older, and ChromeOS.  
 If you're running macOS Catalina (10.15) and newer, use Logitech Options or Logitech Options+ to add and remove unifying devices.
2. Remove any Logitech Unifying Receiver currently connected to your PC.
3. Launch the Logitech Unifying app.
4. A welcome screen will appear. Tap**Next** .
5. The installer will prompt you to connect a Logitech Unifying Receiver to your computer. Connect it to an open USB port. Tap**Next** .
6. The next screen instructs you to turn your wireless mouse off and then back on. Do so and click**Next** .

 The Logitech Unifying Receiver may not detect your wireless Logitech mouse during this step if it's currently connected to your computer over Bluetooth. Disconnect it from Bluetooth to resolve this problem.
7. Your mouse should now be connected. The final screen will ask you to confirm your mouse pointer is working. Select the**Yes** radio button and then click**Exit** .

 FAQ

* How do I replace the receiver for a wireless mouse?  
 If you lost your Logitech wireless mouse's Unifying USB receiver, you can buy a replacement receiver on the Logitech website or Amazon.
* How do I connect a Logitech wireless mouse without a receiver?  
 If your Logitech wireless mouse supports Bluetooth, you can connect it via Bluetooth instead of a receiver. To do this on a Windows 10 PC, go to**Settings** \>**Devices** \>**Add Bluetooth** . On your mouse, press the**Connect** button; the device should appear as an available Bluetooth device on your screen. Select it to complete the pairing process and use your mouse.
* Can I fix my Logitech wireless mouse receiver?  
 Possibly. First,[ update your Unifying Receiver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-logitech-unifying-receiver-4768666) if necessary. Then try uninstalling and reinstalling the software, then sync your mouse to the receiver. Check if you have the correct USB drivers installed on your PC.

 No. For example, Logitech's gaming mice don't support the Unifying Receiver and instead use Logitech's "Lightspeed" wireless feature. You can identify wireless Logitech mice compatible with Unifying by the square, sun-like icon printed on the mouse. This icon is also on the Unifying Receiver.

 Wireless Logitech mice and keyboards that connect to a Unifying Receiver can't connect to other receivers, including those made by Logitech. However, some wireless devices compatible with the Unifying Receiver also support Bluetooth.
