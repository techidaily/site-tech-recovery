 FAQ

* How do I replace the receiver for a wireless mouse?  
 If you lost your Logitech wireless mouse's Unifying USB receiver, you can buy a replacement receiver on the Logitech website or Amazon.

On your mouse, press the**Connect** button; the device should appear as an available Bluetooth device on your screen. Select it to complete the pairing process and use your mouse.
* Can I fix my Logitech wireless mouse receiver?  
 Possibly. First,[ update your Unifying Receiver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-logitech-unifying-receiver-4768666) if necessary. Then try uninstalling and reinstalling the software, then sync your mouse to the receiver. Check if you have the correct USB drivers installed on your PC.

 Wireless Logitech mice and keyboards that connect to a Unifying Receiver can't connect to other receivers, including those made by Logitech. However, some wireless devices compatible with the Unifying Receiver also support Bluetooth.
