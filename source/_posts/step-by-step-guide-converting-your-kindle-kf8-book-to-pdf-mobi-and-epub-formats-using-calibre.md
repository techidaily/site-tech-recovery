Important notice:

On August 8th, 2024, Amazon released Kindle for PC version 2.4.1\. Unfortunately, this update prevents the removal of Kindle DRM. As a result, Kindle books downloaded via Kindle for PC 2.4.1 or later, and Kindle for Mac 1.40 later, cannot be decrypted by Epubor Ultimate or the Calibre DeDRM plugin.

**Solution**:  
• For Windows users: Download [Kindle for PC version 2.4.0](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForPC-installer-2.4.0-70904.exe) and re-download your Kindle books to remove DRM.  
• For Mac users: Download [Kindle for Mac version 1.40](https://download.epubor.com/KindleForMac-installer-1.40.dmg) and re-download your Kindle books to remove DRM.

**Ultimate Solution**:  
If you own a Kindle e-ink device, you can download your Kindle books through the ['Download & Transfer via USB'](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) option on the Amazon website. This method provides AZW3 files, which can be decrypted using Epubor Ultimate.

Great news for Calibre users! The latest version of the DeDRM plugin now supports the KFX format, making it easy to import KFX books into Calibre. This allows you to remove KFX DRM for creating backups and converting them to other formats. In this article, I'll show you step-by-step how to remove DRM from KFX books and convert them to Mobi, EPUB, or PDF.

### 1\. How to Convert Kindle KFX to EPUB/PDF/Mobi with Calibre

The DeDRM Calibre plugin is intended to help anyone looking for free software for removing DRM from their purchased Kindle KFX ebooks. But we have to admit that the biggest inconvenience about using Calibre to remove DRM is that you have to install De-DRM Plugin and KFX Conversion Input Plugin to Calibre first. And this is also the most difficult and also indispensable part to use Calibre to convert DRMed KFX books to EPUB/PDF/TXT... 

Step 1Download [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) to your computer and launch it.

Step 2Download [DeDRM\_tools](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM%5Ftools/releases/download/v10.0.9/DeDRM%5Ftools%5F10.0.9.zip)(v10.0.9) and [KFX Conversion Input Plugin](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291290) to your computer. 

Remember to unzip the DeDRM\_tools plugin package, or you won't be able to load the plugin to calibre successfully. 

Step 3Load DeDRM Calibre Plugin and KFX Conversion Input Plugin to Calibre.

Open calibre's **Preferences** dialog. Click on the **Plugins** button. Next, click on the **Load plugin from file** button.

![load dedrm tool](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/load-dedrm-tool.png)

Navigate to the DeDRM\_tools folder and, find the file **DeDRM\_plugin.zip**. Click to select the file and select **Open**. 

![dedrm calibre plugin zip file 2023](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/dedrm-plugin-zip-file.png)

Click **Yes** in the 'Are you sure?' dialog box. Click the **OK** button in the 'Success' dialog box.

![calibre yes](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-yes.png) ![calibre ok](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-ok.png)

Then repeat the same operation to load the **zipped KFX Input folder** to Calibre(**You do not need to unzip KFX input plugin**).

And the DeDRM plugin will be displayed under File type.

![dedrm location](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/dedrm-location.png)

The KFX Input plugin will be displayed under 'Conversion input'. 

![kfx input plugin](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre-kfx-plugin.png)

Step 4Add Kindle KFX books to Calibre by clicking **Add books** in the tool bar. 

 You need to download KFX books with Kindle for PC/Mac or Kindle e-ink Reader first, then add KFX books from 'My Kindle Content' folder or the Kindle's Document folder to Calibre manually. The book will be decrypted soon after you add it to Calibre library.

![convert books1](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-books1.png)

The KFX books downloaded with Kindle for PC/Mac will be saved in .azw format. 

![kfx content Pc](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kfx-content-Pc.png)

While the KFX books downloaded with Kindle device will be saved in .kfx format. 

![kfx content device](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kfx-content-device.png)

When you add KFX books to Calibre library, please make sure that your know exactly where your downloaded KFX books are stored on your computer.

If your KFX books are downloaded to your computer with Kindle for PC/Mac, you need to add KFX books to Calibre library from 'My Kindle Document' folder.

![add kfx from my kindle document](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/add-kfx-from-my-kindle-document.png)

Step 5Convert KFX to EPUB/Mobi/PDF

Click **Convert books** in the tool bar and choose EPUB/Mobi/PDF/AZW3/TXT/DOCX... as the output format and click **OK** to start the conversion. 

![convert kfx to pdf with calibre](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-kfx-to-pdf-with-calibre.png)

The book will have two formats for you to choose from after the conversion.

### 3\. Calibre VS. Epubor Ultimate

Calibre is an open source freeware ebook library manager. It is the best tool around for keeping track of your ebooks. The DeDRM plugin for Calibre provides a free way to remove DRM from your Kindle and Adobe DRM ebooks. Though Epubor Ultimate is a paid software, it has absolute advantage over Calibre. First of all, you don't have to download the DeDRM plugins and the KFX Conversion Input Plugin. This could be a pain in the ass if you are a tech newbie. Second, Epubor Ultimate supports removing DRM from KFX books downloaded from Kindle e-Ink Reader. Third, Epubor Ultimate can automatically detect all of your downloaded Kindle books, so you don't need to add your downloaded KFX books to the software manually. 

In a word, Calibre is not as easy as Epubor Ultimate, it's a little difficult to handle for some people who is not skillful. Epubor Ultimate can definitely save you a lot of trouble by converting DRMed books to Mobi/ePub/PDF... So it totally worths your money. And if you are not satisfied with Epubor software, you can get your money back within 30 days after you place the order.

### Conclusion

When comparing Calibre and Epubor Ultimate, both tools have their own advantages. However, Epubor Ultimate is more efficient and convenient for removing DRM from KFX books and converting them to other ebook formats. If you are not tech-savvy, we strongly recommend using Epubor Ultimate, as it allows you to solve the problem smoothly.

I don't see any new Plug-Ins:  
 \-De-DRM is 7.2.1 from 2022  
 \-KFX-Input is 1.50.0 also 2022  
 Neither of them work to convert KFX files.

 It would appear that Amazon are now checking the Kindle for PC version. I have a book from 2023 and it will not download into my KfPC V1.17.  
 J Howell states somewhere that he has still cracked KFX conversion.

 Any chance in the near future of sorting out KFX conversion in Calibre?

Please ensure you are using the Kindle for pc/mac version before 1.25 to download the Kindle kfx ebooks. Then run Epubor Ultimate to remove the drm, I am pretty sure it works fine. If you can not figure out how to do it, please contact our customer service support@epubor.com to get more assistance.

Hello,

 Yes after Kindle desktop v1.25 and firmware 5.10.2 released, amazon kindle changed their drm scheme technology, which results in drm removing failed.

 You'd better downgrade your Kindle for PC/Mac to 1.24(1.23) and STOP auto-update.

 Then, use either Epubor or Calibre to help you.

Awesome. Thanks for this guide. I was able to finally get it to work!  
 For me, 2.24 version didn't work. I tried 1.17 version, the file was automatically shown in Calibre as AZW instead of KFX-ZIP. Though I had to disable my Windows Defender Firewall and Security Software to be able to successfully download DeDRM 6.8, KFX and Kindle 1.17 version. Now, I’m a happy camper… Enjoy

It absolutely was a very depressing dilemma in my circumstances, but taking a look at the specialised technique you dealt with the issue forced me to cry with gladness.

Yes, that's because the latest calibre version 5.0 or later is not compatible with the calibre drm-removal plugin. Please follow this guide to get this problem fixed: <https://www.epubor.com/solutions-to-calibre-dedrm-plugin-not-working.html>

I downloaded the DeDRM Calibre Plugin and KFX Conversion Input Plugin, and installed them to Calibre. I'm running Calibre 3.30

 I downloaded a Kindle Book (using Kindle 1.26.1), and located the .AZW file.

 When added to Calibre, the book cover now appears, and the format is KFX-ZIP. When I try to convert to ePub, I get an error that the book contains DRM and cannot be converted.

 What am I missing? Thanks!!

I must express appreciation to the writer just for bailing me out of this type of difficulty. Just after checking throughout the world wide web and seeing suggestions that were not pleasant, I figured my life was over. Living devoid of the strategies to the problems you've resolved by means of your main website is a serious case, as well as ones which could have adversely damaged my entire career if I had not encountered your website. That know-how and kindness in taking care of every aspect was valuable. I don't know what I would have done if I had not come across such a step like this. It's possible to at this moment relish my future. Thanks so much for this specialized and amazing guide. I won't think twice to endorse your web sites to any person who requires direction on this subject.

For those of you who are still struggling rent your books through a digital library and go ahead download adobe digital editions 4.5\. Once you rented click on download epub make sure the book is going to adobe digital. Calibre works perfectly with adobe, I've used kindle pc 4 months ago with no problem and now kfx has been implemented on all books calibre fails to dedrm.

"A terrific good news for loyal Calibre users is last week Apprentice Alf released a new version of the DeDRM tools with added support for KFX format, so now you can easily import KFX books to Calibre to remove KFX DRM in order to create backups and convert them to other formats."

 The link to the dedrm tool on this page references 7.21 from 2021 and does not include kfx, despite the blurb.

I installed the latest version of DeDRM (10.0.1?) and the KFX plugin. Both installed fine, but an Amazon book I bought and downloaded today isn't "cleaned" after being loaded in Calibre, so it wouldn't convert(message: Has DRM). I'm using the latest Kindle for PC (1.39), and version 3.48 of Calibre. Any thoughts?

This applies to books from Kindle Unlimited

 The DeDRM tools with added support for KFX format is NOT working in Calibre with new books from Kindle Unlimited. It will not strip the DRM.   
 Epubor Ultimate is also not working. When downgrading from version 1.35, you cannot save the book into your Kindle for PC anymore. Will there be upgrade or they already win? :-)

 well why did I pay for Epubor Ultimate and now have no way of removing drm from my existing books because it tells me that it will no longer download my books that I am purchasing unless I use a newer version of Kindle for pc?

 kindle for pc is up to v1.36 and you still have not found a workaround?

The link to the KFX plugin in your page did not work, it brings you to a page that says "invalid attachment" 

  
 I tried to download it somewhere else. And did download some KFX input plugin, but when I tried to import it into calibre there was no plugin at all that I could upload. I could not find any workable one. I am using Mac I don't know if it has something to do with it. 

 I would be happy for some help. Best regards
