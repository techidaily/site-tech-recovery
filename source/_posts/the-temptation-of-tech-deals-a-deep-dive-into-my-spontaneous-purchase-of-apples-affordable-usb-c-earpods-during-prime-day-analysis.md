## Navigating Impulse Purchases on Prime Day: How the Allure of Affordable Apple EarPods with USB-C Led to My Spontaneous Acquisition | Insights

No, it's not a typo. You can now buy [Apple's USB-C EarPods](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-EarPods-Headphones-Built-Control%2Fdp%2FB0CHXC5ZDX%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C03960083-c38d-47d0-99cd-4447d67deb5b%7Cdtp&dtb=1), not AirPods, for $17 (11% off) on Amazon. The discount is no [Prime Day](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-live-2024-07-15/) doorbuster, but take it from me: You'll want to buy a pair of these in-ear headphones even if you already own wireless earbuds or aren't an Apple user.

In fact, I just returned home from a work trip to Paris, and I can't even count the number of times the USB-C EarPods helped me stay productive, entertained, and connected with family and friends during my downtime. Here's how else it shines for the price.

For one, wired earbuds don't need to be charged; you just plug them into a phone, laptop, or tablet, and you're all set for your audio needs. This latest model that Apple is selling just so happens to have a USB-C plug, meaning it'll work with just about any modern piece of technology, including the [latest iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/).

Secondly, the microphone quality on Apple's wired EarPods is some of the best I've heard. For video meetings, phone calls, and even voice recording, the EarPods' microphone is on par with lavaliers that cost significantly more. I've used these to record several video scripts for ZDNET's social media channels, and it blows my mind every time I hear how crisp the audio comes out.

It should come as no surprise that I quickly bought another pair of USB-C [Apple EarPods](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-EarPods-Headphones-Built-Control%2Fdp%2FB0CHXC5ZDX%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C03960083-c38d-47d0-99cd-4447d67deb5b%7Cdtp&dtb=1) when they finally went on sale this morning. You can bet I'll be bringing them along for more plane rides and commutes throughout the summer.
