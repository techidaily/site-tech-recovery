## Expert Advice for When Windows 11 Doesn't Turn Off Correctly: Solutions Inside
 Powering down a device is a common first step when troubleshooting nearly any tech issue, and Windows 11 is no exception. But what do you do if your computer won't shut down? Fortunately, there are several easy fixes.

## Why the Computer Won't Shut Down

 A computer that stays on when you try to shut down is often due to a problem related to software. Either the operating system is experiencing a bug or a program is interfering with the PC's ability to work properly.

 Another reason is a broken power button. This is rare, so most people don't need to worry about that, but even so, there are other ways to get Windows 11 to shut down even without using the physical power button.

 It could also be the case that there's nothing wrong with Windows or the power button, but instead, a specific setting is turned off, making it appear as though you can't shut down even when pressing the power button.  

## What to Do If Windows 11 Isn't Shutting Down

 Depending on how you're used to shutting down, being unable to turn off the computer can usually be fixed using a different shutdown technique.

1. [Change what happens when the power button is pressed](https://www.lifewire.com/power-button-and-on-off-symbols-2625969) . The most likely reason Windows 11 won't shut down with the power button is that it's set up to do something other than turn it off.  
 To check if this is the reason the computer won't shut down,[open Control Panel](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-control-panel-2625782) and go to**Hardware and Sound** \>**Power Options** \>**Choose what the power buttons do** . Change the power button option to**Shut down** , and then select**Save changes** .  
![The Shut Down option selected for the Windows 11 power button](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_CweYhNgBZvbujW04OXAdHdnCHo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/windows-11-power-button-settings-7e54e70e9cae41b9bb191aa255dcf9a2.png)  
 This setting exists to prevent accidental shutdowns. You know, when you reach across the desk for something and accidentally touch the power and the shutdown procedure begins. You're likely aware no amount of pleading will stop the process. It happened often enough that Microsoft added a setting to customize the behavior of the power button.  
 Windows 11 will now shut down normally after pressing the power button. If you still can't get it to turn off, continue with these steps.
2. Hold down the physical power button until the computer shuts off.  
 Even if there's a software malfunction preventing you from turning off Windows 11 with the mouse or keyboard, most computers will respond to a press-and-hold of the power button. This is pretty much your only option if[your computer is frozen](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-frozen-computer-5217030) , and it works regardless of the power button setting in Control Panel.  
 This isn't a normal way to turn off a computer because it doesn't give Windows the heads-up it needs to safely shut down. If you're able, ensure that open programs are shut down and all your work is saved.
3. Open the Start menu and press the power icon to find**Shut down** . If you typically use the power button to shut down, try the normal way. The power button may be the source of the problem, in which case using any Windows 11 shutdown method will turn it off.
4. Press**Ctrl** +**Alt** +**Del** and then select the power icon, followed by**Shut down** . One reason you can't shut down Windows 11 is if the Start menu isn't responding and therefore not opening, but[Ctrl+Alt+Del](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ctrl-alt-del-2625830) might still work.

5. In some really specific situations, you might only have access to the command line, like[Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/command-prompt-2625840) . The power button, desktop, and mouse could all be broken and this will still work to shut off your PC.  
 You can make the computer shut down here with the[shutdown command](https://www.lifewire.com/shutdown-command-2618100) . Just type this and then press**Enter** :

6. If your laptop won't shut down, unplug it from the wall and[remove the battery](https://www.lifewire.com/remove-your-laptops-battery-when-plugged-in-2378119) . This will turn it off immediately.
7. One of the previous steps should have been successful in turning off your Windows 11 computer, but if this is a recurring issue, make sure Windows and your device drivers are fully updated.  
[Run Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) to check for OS updates, and[use a driver updater tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-driver-updater-tools-2619206) to install outdated or missing device drivers.
8. [Troubleshoot when Windows Update gets stuck or frozen](https://www.lifewire.com/when-windows-update-gets-stuck-or-frozen-2624439) . There are several things you can try if this is the reason your computer won't fully shut down.
9. [Run System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) to restore the computer to a previous state, presumably one where it was letting you shut down normally.
