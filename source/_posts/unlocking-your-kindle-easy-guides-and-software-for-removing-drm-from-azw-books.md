After you installed all the programs well, Remove drm from kindle azw now:

1**Run Kindle Drm Removal to remove drm from kindle(azw, prc, mobi).**

### Part 2: Remove DRM from azw files with Calibre Plugin

#### **Want to Remove DRM from eReader PDB, Nook, PDF, Kindle, AZW, Mobi etc.?**

You can use Calibre Plugins(support Windows and Mac). Calibre is the best ebook converter, manager and transfer, with Plugins DRM Removal Tools, you can also remove DRM from PDB, ePUB, Bbeb, PDF AZW, Mobi etc.

#### **How to remove DRM from Kindle.**

First, learn more and download [Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

Second, Download plugin file: **DeDRM\_plugin.zip**

This plugin is meant to decrypt Kindle AZW&Mobi . It is meant to function without having to install any dependencies... other than having Calibre installed, of course. It will still work if you have Python and PyCrypto already installed, but they aren't necessary.

#### **Plugins Installation:**

Go to Calibre's Preferences page. Do \*\*NOT\*\* select "Get plugins to enhance calibre" as this is reserved for "official" calibre plugins, instead select "Change calibre behavior".

Just tried it.  
 Installed the plugin according to the instructions. Installed OK, restarted calibre, but still get the pop-up window just as before:  
 "This book is DRMed"

There is a step missing from the Tutorial. You need to double click on the plugin in Caliber, then enter your Kindle Serial Number. I worked like a charm.

Followup: Found my problem.  
 I had added the ebook file after installing calibre, but before installing the plugin.  
 In that case, installing the plugin will not re-read the ebook.  
 Solution: Delete the file from calibre, then add it again.

I had the same problem until I followed the tip from Riad, posted on 11/30/2011\. Double click on the plug-in and enter your Kindle's serial number. Then, delete the book from the calibre library and reload it. It works great!

I wish to express my appreciation to this writer for bailing me out of this scenario. After surfing around through the the web and coming across basics which are not pleasant, I was thinking my entire life was well over. Living without the answers to the issues you've sorted out by means of your main posting is a crucial case, and the kind that could have negatively damaged my career if I had not noticed your website. Your actual know-how and kindness in touching every part was important. I am not sure what I would have done if I had not come upon such a subject like this. I'm able to at this time look forward to my future. Thanks for your time very much for this specialized and effective help. I won't hesitate to recommend your site to anyone who desires support on this matter.

Success! DRM removal fixed! 

 As listed above, I am using the most current versions of Calibre 0.8.41 and the plugins 4.8\. The issue was I installed the most current version of Kindle for PC, 1.9.1\. Apparently, after version 1.8.3, Kindle changed its format of it's DRM breaking the current DRM removal tools. 

 The solution, Deactivate the currently installed version of Kindle for PC and uninstall it, download version 1.8.3 or eariler, install it, re-download all of my e-books. Also don't forget to uncheck automatic updating in Kindle for PC, Tools &gt; Options &gt; General or it will upgrade back to the newest version and break the DRM removal plugin again.... 

 I hope this is helpful to someone.....

The calibre plugin works!! I use a calibre on debian linux. At first when I installed the plugin, I still saw the DRM locked sign pop up when I read in a book. Then I delete the books, restart the cablibre and readd those books. There is still the 'error code...' showing up when adding a book, but finally when I double click the added books, they can be opened.

This is so surprisingly open-handed of people like you to provide without restraint precisely what some people would've offered for sale for an e-book to generate some profit on their own, most importantly given that you might have done it in the event you considered necessary. These secrets additionally served to be a easy way to understand that someone else have the same passion like my own to find out great deal more regarding this issue. I know there are lots of more enjoyable moments up front for people who discover your site.

Hi, Mitch

 Actually, as long as your Kindle books are synced / downloaded with Kindle for PC/Mac app, your Kindle books will come in AZW, which is also how you get your Kindle books decrypted.

 If you copy Kindle books from your Kindle device or download from Amazon site, the Kindle books may not be decrypted.

 Yes.   
 1\. Register the Kindle for PC with your Amazon account, double-click each item to have them downloaded.  
 2\. Get Kindle books from default Kindle content folder ("...\\(My) Documents\\My Kindle Content\\...") and you will be able to decrypt them.

 I did this today, unsuccessfully at first. On the latest version of Kindle4pc the downloaded books appear in the kindle content as e.g. BOOK59QO74\_EBOK.azw - and calibre does not recognise it, even if you change it to the true name. However, when I downloaded the book directly from the Amazon manage your kindle site and renamed the extension as azw (it had downloaded as azw3) then calibre accepted it and stripped the drm, whereas when I had tried it with the extension azw3 just got the usual drm box not allowing. Worked beautifully with an azw extension, came into calibre as a mobi. Thought I would share this as it might help others.

Thank you sooo much for posting this. I was getting discouraged when it wasn't working. I had tried entering my kindle serial number, reloading the book in calibre and opening and closing calibre to no avail. I copied and changed the file to azw instead of azw3 and it finally worked! Thank you!

Chris, you won't find the extension on the Amazon manage your kindle page. From this page first you download the book, i.e. under Actions click on "download & transfer via USB" This will bring it to the selected file on your pc. You can then change the extension using rename to delete the 3\. Then bring it into Calibre through "Add Books". It comes into Calibre as a mobi file with the DRM removed. Hope this helps.

Did you enter your kindle serial number into the plug-in after you imported the file to Calibre. there are a couple of comments regarding this need. It might help.

Of my 140 books on Kindle for Mac, I've 110 converted. I'm using 1.10.6 version of Kindle for Mac and trying to get to Calibre, convert, then to my new Nook Simple Touch. My 1st Gen Nook finally passed on to the great electronic beyond after 5 years of faithful service. Help!

 I'm wondering if it is because I have the most reason version of Kfor Mac, like Jim and others referenced above with Kindle for PC. But which version is the one before Amazon did its black magic and where can I find it?

 Thank you!!

I intended to send you the little bit of observation to finally thank you very much once again for all the fantastic information you have documented above. It was simply shockingly generous of people like you to grant unreservedly what exactly many individuals could possibly have supplied for an electronic book to help with making some bucks on their own, notably considering that you could have tried it if you ever wanted. The guidelines in addition served like a great way to understand that other people online have the identical eagerness much like my personal own to understand many more pertaining to this issue. I know there are millions of more enjoyable sessions in the future for individuals that see your site.

This worked great for me...eventually. I used a Kindle for PC to get my digital books. My issue was I added a book to try and convert before I got the proper plugins so when I would try to convert it from Kindle format to EPUB it would still give me the error. TRICK IS TO INSTALL PLUGINS FIRST AND THEN ADD BOOKs. I deleted the book I added before I downloaded the plugins and re-added it after the plugins and it worked perfectly!

 Thanks for the tip billp!

Thanks for your comment. We were aware of this issue.  
 It requires the latest Kindle app to download it. Epubor Ultimate can still work with books published before 2023.

 For the ebooks published in 2023, here is still another way to remove DRM if you have any Kindle device (Kindle fire or kindle eink device) registered with your Amazon account.

 Please download the Kindle books via "Download and transfer via usb" and then remove kindle drm with Epubor Ultimate.

 Here is the detailed guide: https://www.epubor.com/how-to-remove-drm-from-kindle-kfx-ebooks.html#meth4

Hi  
 But your "another way" via USB transfer don't work for Kindle Unlimited.

 This is lots of time without ANY information about your progress or if you try to find a solution at all....

 I hope that your clients deserve better approach

Hello, thanks for your comment. Kindle Unlimited is a rental service, so you don't actually own the books. Therefore, Epubor software can't convert Kindle Unlimited books for you. You can decrypt other books you purchased from Amazon Kindle via Epubor Ultimate.

 If there are other questions, please feel free to contact us.
