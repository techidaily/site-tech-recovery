### Key Takeaways

* Facebook Marketplace alerts help you find items quickly.
* Set up alerts by searching for an item and clicking "Notify Me."

 Facebook Marketplace has become the go-to place for selling things online. If you're on the lookout for a specific item, an alert can help you snag a great deal before everyone else. You can skip the search process and always know when new items are posted. We'll show you how—it's super handy.

##  Set Up Facebook Marketplace Alerts

 First, head on over to [Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/) in a desktop browser such as Google Chrome. Click the "Marketplace" shortcut in the sidebar or top bar.

 A little pop-up window will appear. Enter a minimum and maximum price and adjust the search radius if you'd like. Click "Create Alert" to finish.

 That's all there is to it![Facebook Marketplace has a lot of advantages](https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/masterful-marketing-essential-expressions-for-professionals-for-2024/) over Craigslist—though it's [certainly not perfect](https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-transform-overload-into-order-with-skillful-tiktok-saves-edits-for-2024/).
