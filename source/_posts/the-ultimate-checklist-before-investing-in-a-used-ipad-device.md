## How Much Should You Spend on a Used iPad?

[Flipsy.com keeps track of average prices for used iPads](https://flipsy.com/article/9048/ipad-price) on eBay, Amazon, and a couple of other online retailers. Used iPads typically go for about half or one-third of their original value. If purchasing a newer model, check the price of[the latest iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-newest-version-of-ipad-1994324) to see if it's worth spending a little more to get a warranty. Used iPads typically have no warranty, but some refurbished ones do.

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <$100       | iPad 4, iPad 3, iPad 2, iPad 1st Gen, iPad Mini 1st Gen, iPad Mini 2 Retina, iPad Mini 3, iPad Air 1st Gen |

## What's the Difference Between Used and Refurbished iPads?

 A refurbished iPad was returned to Apple and repaired. If you[buy a refurbished iPad from Apple](https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad) , you save money and—more importantly—receive the same one-year[iPad warranty from Apple](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-ipad-warranty-4688628) as a new iPad carries. However, you may be able to buy a used iPad directly from its owner at a lower price.

## Where Should I Buy a Used iPad?

 If you have a friend, a relative, or a friend-of-a-friend selling an iPad, you have this part solved. Buying from someone you know reduces the stress of the exchange. You still need to buy the right iPad for a reasonable price and review what to do during and after the transaction. Other possibilities include:

* **Buy from eBay** : One great thing about eBay is the layer between you and the buyer. You can rely on eBay if the item you receive isn't the same as the description. However, be aware of any shipping costs.
* **Buy from Amazon** : Yes, Amazon has a used marketplace. You can see new and used prices if you search for an iPad. The used price is the cheapest overall cost, combining both the iPad cost and any shipping costs.
* **Buy from Craigslist** : The internet version of a classified ads section of the paper, you can buy and sell almost anything on Craigslist. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees when you[purchase an iPad on Craigslist](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-buy-ipad-craigslist-1994393) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## What Condition Should a Used iPad Be In?

 Examine the iPad to see if it appears to be in good shape. Check the screen for any cracks and the case for any dents. A small dent in the outer casing of the iPad isn't a big deal, but any damage to the screen is a deal-breaker.**Do not buy an iPad with a cracked screen** , even if it is only a tiny crack outside the display. A small crack tends to lead to a bigger one, and you may be surprised by how quickly it can transform into a shattered screen.

 Launch a few apps, including the Notes app, which allows you to use the on-screen keyboard. Open the[Safari web browser](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-safari-4173608) and go to several websites if you have Wi-Fi access.

 Plug the iPad into a wall outlet and confirm the battery icon in the upper-right corner shows a lightning bolt, which means it is charging. That indicates the port at the bottom of the iPad is in good working order.

## How Old Should a Used iPad Be?

 Look at models from the last two years. These models are the most powerful, with the most features, and Apple will support them for years.

 Check the model number advertised to ensure it matches the iPad model you buy. Double-check if the person you're buying from seems uncertain of the model. You can[find the iPad's model number](https://www.lifewire.com/find-your-ipads-model-number-1994687) in the**Settings** app.  

## Who Should Buy a Used iPad?

 If you've never had an iPad or other Apple products, trying a used one can help you decide if you want to spend more money on a new one. If you're familiar with Apple products but don't care about having the latest and greatest version, an older used iPad will meet your needs if you want to listen to music and browse the web. If you need an iPad for work or to play online games with 3D graphics, you're better off with a new one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## After You Buy a Previously Owned iPad

 After you check everything out, reset the iPad. Even if the[iPad was restored to factory default settings](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reset-your-ipad-1994506) when you picked it up, you should reset it before the purchase is complete. It doesn't take long to reset, and knowing that services such as Find My iPad are off when you take possession is worth the hassle.

 As important as it is to turn off Find My iPad when buying a used iPad, it's essential to turn it on after you take possession and set it up for your use. The setup process should prompt you to do so, but if it doesn't, we have a[guide on how to turn on Find My iPad](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-find-my-ipad-on-off-1994525) . This feature doesn't just locate the iPad if it's missing; it also allows you to put it in lost mode or remotely reset it.

## Which iPad to Buy

 Deciding on the best place to buy a used iPad is crucial; the essential part of the process is ensuring you buy the right one. You want to avoid getting stuck with an obsolete iPad within a year or two.

 When[comparing iPad models](https://www.lifewire.com/ipad-comparison-chart-1994214) , consider the price, display size, camera quality, CPU, and storage space. Avoid unsupported iPad models. Obsolete iPads no longer get operating system updates, and many new apps don't work on them.

[Full List of Obsolete and Outdated iPads](https://www.lifewire.com/obsolete-ipad-4138570)

 The 3rd-generation iPad's life span was just 221 days. It was the last iPad to support the old 30-pin dock connector. It was replaced by the iPad 4 with a Lightning connector.
