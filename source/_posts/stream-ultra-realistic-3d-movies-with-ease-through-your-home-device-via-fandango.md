## iOS 18 Release Date

 Apple debuted iOS 18 at the keynote for the[Worldwide Developers Conference](https://www.lifewire.com/wwdc-5101136) on June 10, 2024\. Its release date is in the fall, probably the second half of September.

 The newest iOS version will install automatically if your phone is compatible. Another way to get iOS 18 this fall is to[update your phone from the Settings app](https://www.lifewire.com/upgrade-ios-on-iphone-connecting-itunes-1999188) .

## iOS 18 Features

 The iPhone gains new and updated features in the switch from iOS 17 to iOS 18\. Here's a quick summary of some of the biggest updates:

**Control Center** : Control Center works differently in iOS 18\. More controls are available, and they're grouped on the screen. You can use different types of settings by swiping down the screen. You can also choose different sizes and layouts for controls.

 A related feature lets you swap out the controls you see on your Lock screen. You can ditch the usual Flashlight and Camera options for ones more useful to you, like Voice Memos or Calendar.

**Game Mode** : This feature already appeared in macOS, but iOS 18 adds it to Phones. Game Mode scales back background processes to help games run more smoothly and work better with controllers and AirPods.

**Home screen customization** : For the first time, iPhone users can skip the full-screen, rigid grid display for their apps. It does still work on a grid, of course, but apps can go at the top, bottom, or sides of the screen without the strict rows of four from top to bottom. The Home screen can also include widgets.

 Another cool option lets you change the size and color of app icons and widgets.

 Along with the home screen layout, iPhone users also have more control over the apps that appear there. A new "Hidden Apps" folder in the App Library will stash items you don't want showing up, and this folder is passcode-protected. You can even lock unhidden apps behind a passcode or Face/Touch ID to keep them secure.

**Mail** : The Mail app also receives a revamp in iOS 18\. Message grouping will make scanning easier, and new categories like Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions will help you filter your inbox and focus on the most important messages.

Apple, Inc.

**Maps** : Maps in iOS 18 includes topographical data and trail information, along with the ability to customize your route. The app also includes trail data for US national parks.

**Messages** : In iOS 18, more "tapback" responses are available, including the ability to quickly react to a message with any emoji. You can also style text with bold, italics, strike-through, and underlining, and schedule texts to send later.

 This version of iOS also supports RCS messaging, meaning that you'll no longer send extremely tiny videos to your friends with Android phones. Another big innovation is Messages via Satellite, which lets you communicate even when you're away from a cellular network.

**Passwords** : This new app will hold and organize all of your credentials. It's an evolution of the iCloud Keychain, except as an app, it will be easer to access and organize.

**Photos** : New topics and carousels let you find pictures faster and keeps them more organized.  

**Safari** : Apple's web browser adds Highlights, which quickly point out the most important information. The Reader will also generate a table of contents and a summary of the article you're reading.

**Wallet** : Tap to Cash lets you transfer Apple Cash between accounts by bringing two iPhones together. Apple Pay will also let you access credit card rewards and installment plans.

 Apple's most touted addition to iOS 18 is[Apple Intelligence](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-gpt-7571221) , an AI-driven platform that works with Siri and integrates with ChatGPT for both text and image generation. Apple Intelligence is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro and later, however.
