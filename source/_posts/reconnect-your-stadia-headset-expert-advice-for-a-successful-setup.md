## Reconnect Your Stadia Headset: Expert Advice for a Successful Setup

Close 

 When a Stadia headset doesn’t connect, you'll find you cannot hear any game sound, and other players can't hear your voice. This issue usually occurs when there’s a faulty connection or faulty hardware, but it can also be caused by your network setup, problems with the Stadia service, and more. To get your Stadia headset connected and working, you’ll typically need to check your headset's compatibility, try a different headset or connection, check your network configuration, and other similar tasks.

##  Causes for a Stadia Headset to Not Connect 

 Due to the way Stadia works, with the game running in the cloud and no hardware other than your Stadia controller and a device like a Chromecast Ultra, your phone, or a web browser on a computer, headsets work differently with the Stadia than they do with traditional game consoles. The headset has to connect to the Stadia controller via either the 3.5mm audio jack or the USB-C port, and it has to be a compatible USB-C headset if you’re using the USB-C port. While the controller has Bluetooth built-in, it isn’t compatible with Bluetooth headsets.

##  How to Fix It When a Stadia Headset Won’t Connect 

 To get your Stadia headset working, try each of these fixes in order. If a step doesn’t apply to your specific headset hardware, you can skip it and try the next one.

1. Don’t use Bluetooth. If you’re trying to use a Bluetooth headset with your Stadia, it won’t work. Stadia controllers do have Bluetooth built-in, but it’s only for the initial setup process. Google may add support for Bluetooth headsets in the future with a firmware update, but until then, you need to use a USB-C or 3.5mm headset.
2. Update your Stadia controller firmware. Under normal circumstances, you’ll receive a prompt to update your Stadia controller whenever a firmware update becomes available. If an update is available but you haven’t received it, you can force an update by resetting the controller.  
   1. Press and hold the**Google Assistant** and**Capture** buttons for six seconds.  
   2. Set up your Stadia controller with the Stadia app.  
   3. Your controller will receive any available firmware updates during the setup process.
3. Connect your Chromecast to Wi-Fi. When using a Stadia headset while playing on Chromecast Ultra, you may need to connect to the Chromecast to the same Wi-Fi network as your Stadia controller. If your router is operating in[ bridge mode](https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-bridging-explained-816563) , you won’t be able to connect your Chromecast via a wired Ethernet connection and use a headset simultaneously. In that case, connecting the Chromecast to the same Wi-Fi connection as your controller will fix the problem.
4. Change your network settings. If you want or need to connect your Chromecast via a wired Ethernet connection, you can get things working by disabling bridge mode on your router.  
 Disabling bridge mode may cause problems with other devices, including game consoles like Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5\. In that case, connect your Chromecast via Wi-Fi, or only disable bridge mode for your Chromecast port.
5. Try a different headset. Stadia controllers support both 3.5mm and USB-C headsets and headphones. If you’re having trouble with one and have a headset or headphones that use the other connection, try that.
6. Make sure your headset is compatible. The 3.5mm audio jack works with all standard TRRS headsets and TRS headphones and the USB-C port works with headphones and headsets designed to work over USB-C. If your headset doesn't, and you’re using an adapter, make sure it’s compatible, and there isn’t an issue with the adapter.  
 Some wireless USB-C headsets work with Stadia controllers. These headsets have a USB-C dongle that plugs into the controller. If you’re trying to use one of these, verify with the manufacturer that it’s compatible with Stadia. It may need a firmware update.
7. Check your headset settings. If you have a headset that works with multiple connection types, like both wired and wireless, make sure it’s set to use the wired connection. Headsets with this option typically have a physical switch.
8. Check for Stadia service interruptions. Start with social media, like the[ Stadia X (formerly Twitter) account](https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia) and the[ #Stadia Down](https://twitter.com/search?q=stadia%20down) hashtag, and consider contacting Stadia customer support. Even if the Stadia service seems to be working, and you’re able to stream games, there may be a limited-service interruption specifically affecting voice chat. If you can hear game sounds but can’t voice chat, this may be the problem.
