### Key Takeaways

 To restart a Windows 11 PC, click the Start button on the taskbar, click the Power button, and then select "Restart." Alternatively, you can also press Alt+F4 on your desktop, select "Restart" from from the drop-down menu, and then click "OK."

 At some point, you'll need to restart your [Windows 11](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-tecno-spark-10-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) PC to troubleshoot an issue, install an update, complete an installation, or otherwise. While you'll often see a "restart" option [when updating](https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-unfortunately-settings-has-stopped-on-realme-v30-quickly-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), here are several other ways to restart your PC manually.

##  Use the Power Button in the Start Menu

![Click the Start power button and select "Restart."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/win11_start_menu_restart.jpg) 

 One of the quickest and most obvious ways to restart is by using the [Start menu](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-clues-to-detecting-an-snapchat-block/). To get started, click the "Start" button in your taskbar. When the Start menu opens, click the power button in the lower-right corner of the menu. In the menu that pops up, select "Restart." Your PC will shut down and restart.

##  Right-Click the Start Menu

 You can also restart Windows 11 using the hidden [power user menu](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-instagram-media-the-finest-downloading-options/). To access it, press Windows+x on your keyboard or right-click the "Start" button. When the menu appears, click "Shut down or sign out," then select "Restart." Your PC will restart immediately.

##  Press Alt+F4 to Restart Windows 11

![Press Alt+F4, select "Restart," then click "OK."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/alt_f4_restart.jpg) 

 Alternately, you can restart your machine with a special menu window that few people know about. First, close or minimize all windows. Click your desktop, then press Alt+F4 on your keyboard. In the "Shut Down Windows" window that appears, use the drop-down menu to select "Restart." Then click "OK."

##  Use the Command Line Restart Command

![At the command prompt, type "shutdown -r" and hit Enter.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shutdown_command.jpg) 

 There's also a quick way to restart your PC if you have access to the Command Prompt or PowerShell. First, open [Windows Terminal](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-acclaimed-software-rankings-top-10-phonepc-video-calls/) by searching "terminal" in Start, then clicking its app icon. At the command prompt, type "shutdown -r" and hit Enter. When you see a warning message, click "Close." Your PC will shut down and restart in 60 seconds.

##  Update and Restart in Windows Update

![Click "Restart Now."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/win11_click_restart_now.jpg) 

 If you have updates available and need to restart to install them, open Settings by pressing Windows+i, then select "Windows Update" in the sidebar. In "Windows Update" settings, click "Check for Updates," and if there are any available, you can install them and restart your PC by clicking "Restart Now." Your PC will [automatically install the updates](https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-unfortunately-settings-has-stopped-on-realme-v30-quickly-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/) and restart.

##  Use Ctrl+Alt+Delete or the Login Screen

 And finally, there's also an easy way to restart from either the Ctrl+Alt+Delete menu (that appears when you press that key combination) or the login screen. On either screen, click the power icon in the lower-right corner, then select "Restart" in the small menu that pops up. Windows 11 will restart your PC, and you'll be back in business in no time.
