### Why can't we directly read Kindle on Kobo?

It's known that Amazon Kindle books are special for Kindle devices. It's formats are not completely compatible with Kobo readers format epub and pdf. Besides, Kindle books we buy online are usually DRM protected.

Kobo official website has also declared that.

In a word, here are 2 reasons that we can't directly read our Kindle books on Kobo:  

* Kindle books are with DRM protection
* Kindle books are with Kindle format, not common epub or pdf

 Now let's learn about how to read Kindle books on Kobo.
