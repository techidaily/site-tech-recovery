##  How to Make a Picture Fit on Instagram 

 Instagram automatically crops posts to an aspect ratio of 4:5 so they don't take up too much space in your feed. Fortunately, the app offers a way to make your photos fit the post preview window, and it's really easy:

1. Choose a photo to post.
2. Tap the**Expand** icon in the lower-left corner of the preview window or pinch your fingers together to zoom out and make it fit.  
 You'll see a white border around the image (or a black border if[ dark mode is turned on in the Instagram app](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-on-dark-mode-on-instagram-5070875) ).
3. Tap**Next** to continue posting.

##  How to Resize a Post for Instagram 

 Instagram's built-in method usually works fine, but if you're unsatisfied with the results, there are plenty of other[ ways to resize a photo](https://www.lifewire.com/free-photo-resizers-1357016) . Kapwing is ideal for resizing Instagram pictures specifically because it can add space around the image so it fits the 4:5 ratio requirements (you can even pick a custom border color).  

1. [ Visit Kapwing.com](https://www.kapwing.com/) and select**Get started** .  
 Kapwing will put a watermark on the bottom right side of the photo. Depending on how the border looks on your picture, a[ photo editing tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-photo-editors-1357098) might be able to cover it up.
2. Sign in with one of the listed methods and complete any first-user steps if this is your first time using this picture resizer.
3. Tap the**arrow** next to Create new, then choose**Upload** .

 FAQ

* How do I fit a whole picture on Instagram without a white background?  
 Because all Instagram posts are 4:5, landscape and portrait images will always have a border. However, you can choose a background color other than white with the Kapwing website.
* How do I post multiple photos on Instagram?  
 To[ post multiple photos on Instagram](https://www.lifewire.com/post-multiple-photos-on-instagram-5069752) , tap**Select Multiple** instead of choosing a single photo, and then choose up to 10 images.
