## Improving Your Emails: How Gmail Adapts for Ultimate Comfort on Smartphones, Tablets, and Phablets

Most Android apps are not optimized for tablets, and the new wave of foldable phones with more tablet-sized screens made that more apparent. Google is rolling out more improvements for Gmail to make it better on foldables and tablets.

 Google has announced several updates aimed at improving Gmail on Android foldables and tablets, specifically focusing on the Gmail and Google Chat apps. One of the standout additions is the new formatting bar in the Gmail app's compose screen. This bar now offers a wider range of formatting options, including font type selection and bulleted lists. You can quickly customize the appearance of your emails, making them more professional and engaging.

 For those who prefer physical keyboards, both Gmail and Chat now offer a handy shortcut feature. By simply pressing the "?" key, you can view a list of helpful keyboard shortcuts, making it easier to navigate and compose messages. Perhaps the most exciting update is the introduction of Smart Compose to Android tablets and foldables. This AI-powered feature, already available on Gmail web, intelligently suggests text as you type, potentially saving you time and effort in composing emails. You can accept suggestions by swiping or using the tab key on an external keyboard.

 These changes are mostly for large-screened devices like the recently-announced [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-instagrams-best-grids-built-by-the-top-tools-compiled-here/). If you have a regular phone, Gmail should still look and work about the same as always. Foldable phones with more phone-shaped screens, like the [Moto Razr](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/top-no-fee-android-chat-apps-rated/) and [Galaxy Z Flip 6](https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-basic-guidebook-to-live-selling-in-todays-digital-world/), will still get the typical phone layout.

 These new features are now available to all Google Workspace customers and anyone with a personal Google account. There isn't a slow feature rollout this time around, but you should make sure you're on the latest version of the Gmail app.
