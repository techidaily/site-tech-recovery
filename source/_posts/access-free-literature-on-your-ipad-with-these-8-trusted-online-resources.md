![free books](http://www.epubor.com/images/i_love_freebies_button.jpg)Everyone loves freebies, who not? When talking about free eBooks, we may think of Amazon Kindle daily free books and Gutenberg public domains. When we mention Apple, the expensive price and personality call to our mind, but never including cheap or even free.

When we enter iTunes iBookstore, we can hardly find a free eBook except those public domains, but how many of us want to read them?

What if I told you that there are thousands of free books for iPad but you don't know where to find them? I am not kidding, and I am just going to tell where and how to find and download them.

### Which format of eBook is accepted by iPad and how to read them on it

With the built-in reading app (iBooks) , you can read ePub and PDF books on iPad. And you can transfer the books to iPad with the official file manager program iTunes. If you don't know how to do it, here is the detailed guide to tell you [how to transfer books to iPad](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

### Website which offers free books for iPad

These sites at least meet following conditions:

1) Provide ePub and PDF books;

2) DRM-free;

3) Free to download, not just free for a short preview;

4) No classical public domain because you can download them in many places for free.

1 Free-eBooks.net

Honestly speaking, this site is not a pure free site: For free registered account, it only provides 5 books to be downloaded per month, and if you want to get unlimited quantity, you have to pay $7.95 per month.

For free account, only TXT and PDF are available; and there is an extra Mobipocket format for paid account.

Site Address: http://www.free-ebooks.net/

2 Getfreeebooks

This is a site that brings both authors and readers into the world of free ebooks. Authors with their free ebooks will benefit greatly from the large community of readers and the readers will in return, of course, will have lots of materials to read to their heartsâ€™ content.

It accepts ebooks submission, and also collect many free books information from many other sites.

Site Address: http://www.getfreeebooks.com/

3 DigiLibraries

DigiLibraries.com offers a digital source of eBooks for any taste, a vast range of titles in digital format and our eBooks collection is growing all the time.

Most of the titles are providing ePub to download, no need to register or some stuff alike, just visit the site and directly download the book.

Site Address: http://www.digilibraries.com

4 obooko

All the books are free on this site and most of them provide PDF format to download, the only setback is you need to register to download books freely.

The website launched from the United Kingdom into Cyberspace in early December 2009 and continues to provide an opportunity for new and established writers from all parts of the world to self-publish and promote their work free of charge.

Site Address: http://www.obooko.com

5 ePubBud

A very famous website to download free books but it shows a decline these years but we still cannot ignore it. Just like the site name, it offers eBooks in ePub format downloading and most of them are suitable for babies and children. You can directly download those books without registration.

The birth of this site is a [sad story](http://www.epubbud.com/about.php), I hope you can spread this site to more daddies and mommies.

Site Address: http://www.epubbud.com

6 EBOOKEE

A typical user generated site, a majority of books on this site are submitted by users. And of course, all the user generated site can't avoid this issue: the spam. There are many no-sense books which are submitted by some people for other purpose like marketing and promotion.

There is also one thing you should pay attention, all the books are stored on online storage site like hotfiles and depositfiles, there might be a download frequency limitation.

Site Address: http://ebookee.org/

7 Bookyards

A very old brand site which established since 2001, has collected more than 800,000 books for free downloading. All the books are collected by the site's staff or at least they will pend the submitted file before publish it on the website. Therefore all the books are valid and valuable.

Their goal/dream is to be "The Library to the World", in which books, education materials, information, reference materials, documents, and content will be provided freely to anyone who has an internet connection.

Site Address: http://www.bookyards.com/

8 MUNSEYS

This site was built even ealier than Bookyards on 1998, it is also a hardcore site which collects tens of thousand of free books. What's more, it provides more than 10 different kinds of formats for downloading, including ePub, Mobi, PDF, and some uncommon format like imp, lrf, rb, etc.

If you have an old out-of-manufacture eBook Reader, you are definitely able to download the suitable format here.

Hi,  
 I have just followed the information you posted to obooko on my iPad and downloaded a few books. But now I can't find them anywhere on my iPad. I have iBooks installed and they haven't gone there, or to the kindle app. Do you have any idea where I can look for these?

 Regards  
 Dee

If you're interested in the classics then you should also take a look at epubBooks.com. The catalog is not as large as others, but the quality of the ebooks is probably the best. Both the site and ebooks work great on any device and many of the titles include the original illustrations.
