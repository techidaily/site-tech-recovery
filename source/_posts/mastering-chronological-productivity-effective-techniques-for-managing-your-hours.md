Long time user of Epubor ultimate. Since Kindle 1.24 stopped working after upgrade to Catalina, moved to KCR converter. But have noticed that Kindle books converted to epub using KCR are slow.

[Parallel Process](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/18/2016 11:56:45 AM 

I think it is good if epubor can do parallel processing.   
 I think current processor are fast enough to parallel process. 

 and sometimes it take very long time to process a book.   
 better to skip it and give a log which we can review later

[Can't decrypt Kindle books anymore](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/11/2019 11:46:51 PM 

Hi there, today I opened my Kindle for PC app and I was unable to decrypt a book. Something has changed with the software, so I tried downloading the 1.24 version as I have done before, but with no luck. Epubor cannot decrypt correctly, it basically creates a version of the ebook in HTMLZ, which lacks some essential features, such as the index. I tried installing the older version multiple times, both the 1.24 and the 1.17 but nothing changes.
