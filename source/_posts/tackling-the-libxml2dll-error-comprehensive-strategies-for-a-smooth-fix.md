## How to Fix a Slow Internet Connection

 Diagnose and fix the causes of your slow[internet](https://www.lifewire.com/difference-between-the-internet-and-the-web-2483335) connection with these steps on your own before you reach out for potentially expensive tech support:

1. **Stop background programs that hog bandwidth** , such as software applications, like[Windows Update](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-windows-update-2624597) and games.  
 Many games run downloaders that patch the game without additional intervention or approval by you. If your download speed suddenly seems slow, find out if your favorite game is downloading a few gigabytes of patch files.
2. **Avoid signal interference that slows your internet speed.** [Reposition your router](https://www.lifewire.com/best-place-for-wireless-router-816570) for better performance and[change your Wi-Fi channel number](https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-channel-number-change-to-avoid-interference-818208) . The closer your device is to the router, the better the Wi-Fi connection.  
 To confirm if wireless interference is the reason for the slow internet connection, connect a computer to Wi-Fi and measure its performance. Then, connect the same computer to the wired network and note any changes in performance.  
 If the cable allows for a better connection, the problem could lie in the wireless connection. Instead of moving the router, consider a[mesh network setup](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178) or a[signal repeater](https://www.lifewire.com/mesh-network-vs-range-extender-4148022) .  
 Large, dense objects such as fireplaces block Wi-Fi signals more than walls. A device that is close to a router, but blocked by a barrier, may not successfully connect.
3. **Make sure your router and other network equipment are working.** To troubleshoot potentially faulty equipment, temporarily rearrange and reconfigure your gear while experimenting with different configurations.  
 Systematically try bypassing the router, swapping cables, and testing with multiple devices to isolate the slow performance of a specific system component. Then, decide if it can be upgraded, repaired, or replaced.
4. **Beware of worms and other malware** by regularly scanning for[viruses and other malware](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Keep up-to-date [anti-virus software](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-antivirus-software-4151895) running to catch and remove worms and malware. In addition, try a[malware-removal tool](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-malware-removal-tools-4771073) .
5. **Check your router settings to speed up your connection.** Ensure your router's settings remain consistent with the manufacturer's documentation and your[internet service provider](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) 's recommendations.  
 Record any changes you make to the router's configuration so you can undo them later if necessary.
6. **Check whether your network speed is slow.** To do this, occasionally run speed tests to check the quality of your internet connection. These tests reveal whether your local computer's outbound connection is impaired. If you get decent throughput on a speed test but your computer's connection still seems slow, the problem may reside in your computer (for example, active download sessions or you've maximized memory, disk, or CPU utilization on your device).  
 If your computer runs above 80 percent consistent utilization for system memory, disk input/output, or CPU cycling, the computer may struggle to maintain optimal performance. Network slowdowns follow—not because the network is problematic but because the computer is overtaxed.  
 To check relative resource utilization to determine whether another component is affecting network performance in Windows 10, right-click the**Start** button, select**Task Manager** , and choose**Performance** . On a Linux computer, use the[top command](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-command-2625828) . On a Mac, open the[Activity Monitor](https://www.lifewire.com/use-activity-monitor-to-track-mac-memory-usage-2260880) .
7. **Call your internet service provider.**  
 Different types of internet connections offer different trade-offs. If you have a DSL connection and experience slowdowns during peak evening-and-weekend periods, it may be that many connected households are using the same access point in your neighborhood.

## Causes of a Slow Internet Connection  

 Several factors could affect your slow internet connection. Games and other programs that work with video require significant[bandwidth](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bandwidth-2625809) . When they run, they limit the bandwidth available for other apps.  
 Other network activity could affect overall bandwidth. A smart TV streaming movies, a camera constantly relaying HD video, and smart speakers playing music can slow everything on the network.  
 Household appliances and your neighbors' wireless networks can also interfere with your computers.  
 In addition, when routers,[modems](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-modem-817861) , or cables malfunction, they don't correctly support network traffic at full speeds. Certain technical glitches in network equipment negatively affect performance even though connections can still be made.  
 You could also have an[internet worm](https://www.lifewire.com/brief-history-of-malware-153616) , a malicious software program that spreads from device to device through computer networks. If any of your computers become infected by an internet worm or other malware, they may spontaneously generate network traffic without your knowledge and cause your internet connection to appear slow.  
 As the centerpiece of a network, a[broadband router](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-broadband-router-816301) can be responsible for slow internet connections if it is misconfigured. For example, improperly setting the router's[MTU](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-mtu-817948) leads to performance problems if it's set too high or too low.
