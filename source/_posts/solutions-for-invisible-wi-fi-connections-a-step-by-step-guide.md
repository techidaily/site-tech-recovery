## Causes for 'Wireless Network Not Showing Up' Issues

 Problems with your router, ISP, or device could prevent your Wi-Fi network from showing up in the list of available networks. It can be caused by these and more issues:

* The device is out of range
* The network adapter is off or disabled
* There's some wireless interference
* It's a hidden Wi-Fi network
* Your device has a virus
* The ISP is having issues

## How to Fix a Wi-Fi Network Not Showing Up

 Try these troubleshooting steps in the order we've listed them (from easiest to most complex) until the Wi-Fi network shows up:

1. Move closer to the router. This is the number one reason the Wi-Fi network is missing from your laptop, phone, tablet, etc.[Routers have a limited range](https://www.lifewire.com/range-of-typical-wifi-network-816564) , so getting closer is the best way to see if this is the problem.  
 If you're struggling to connect to Wi-Fi from a device that can't be moved, like a TV, you might need to upgrade your network with a[long-range router](https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554) . However, distance is just one possible cause for missing Wi-Fi, so try these other solutions before you commit to purchasing a new router or[Wi-Fi range extender](https://www.lifewire.com/best-wifi-extenders-4043312) .
2. Ensure that the right items are connected and switched on. Here are a few things to look for:  
   * Is the router plugged into power? If you're getting wired internet, then the answer is yes. Check if you're not sure.  
   * Does your laptop have a Wi-Fi switch? Some are physical switches and others are toggles on the keyboard. If it's set to the off position, simply flip it on to see all the Wi-Fi networks around you.
3. [Turn off Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/when-and-how-to-turn-off-wifi-818302) , wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This is like a mini reboot of just Wi-Fi.
4. [Restart the modem and router](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-properly-restart-a-router-modem-2624570) . Power cycling this hardware can fix internet connectivity issues and resolve problems with wireless connections.
5. Restart your device. The router is just one piece of the puzzle;[restarting your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) or phone, too, can fix the missing Wi-Fi network if a hiccup on your device is the reason it's gone.  
 In some cases, you might need to force your computer off by holding down the power button for a full minute. This is not the usual way of rebooting, but it might be necessary to fix this issue. Once it's off, wait a few seconds before switching it on.
6. [Connect to the hidden network](https://www.lifewire.com/understanding-hidden-wifi-networks-5216351) , assuming it's actually hiding. A Wi-Fi network can have its SSID set to not broadcast to devices, making it appear to be missing when it's really just not easily visible.
7. Look for interference. This is one of the many[reasons Wi-Fi connections drop](https://www.lifewire.com/reasons-why-wifi-connections-drop-818210) . Numerous objects around a home or office can interfere with a wireless router. Potential issues include thick walls, appliances, fluorescent lights, and other wireless devices, like security cameras.  
 Neighboring wireless networks could also interfere with your own.[Changing your Wi-Fi channel](https://www.lifewire.com/wifi-channel-number-change-to-avoid-interference-818208) number could resolve the issue.
8. [Restart the WLAN AutoConfig service](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-4107276) if the Wi-Fi network has disappeared from your Windows computer. This service is responsible for finding Wi-Fi networks, so your PC could have trouble finding the network if this service has been stopped or is having problems.

9. [Log in to the router](https://www.lifewire.com/accessing-your-router-at-home-818205) and turn on the 2.4 GHz network. Some devices (mostly older ones) can't connect on the 5 GHz band, so if your router supports broadcasting both, do that.  
[Is 5 GHz Wi-Fi Better Than 2.4 GHz?](https://www.lifewire.com/is-5-ghz-wifi-better-than-2-4-ghz-818293)
10. Disable the[VPN](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-vpn-5189778) if you're using one. A VPN can interfere with normal network functionality.  
 You might be using a VPN without knowing it. They're included in some security software, so look around your antivirus program and ad blocker for any mention of one.
11. Uninstall the wireless device in Device Manager and then restart your computer. Windows will add it back automatically, hopefully fixing the problem in the process.  
 To do this,[open Device Manager](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-device-manager-2626075) and go to**View** \>**Show hidden devices** . Expand the**Network adapters** group, right-click the wireless device, and then select**Uninstall device** . Don't forget to reboot!
12. [Install any missing device drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . A missing network adapter driver could be the reason you can't see your Wi-Fi network, but this is almost always a problem only if you just recently installed Windows.  
 If the wired network doesn't work either, you'll need to use a working computer to download the driver. You can then put it on a flash drive to install it on the nonworking computer.
13. [Scan your computer for malware](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . A virus infection can cause all kinds of problems, one of which could be related to connecting to a Wi-Fi network.
14. Contact your[ISP](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924) . If your troubleshooting efforts haven't been able to fix the Wi-Fi problem, the ISP, who's responsible for delivering internet to your house, can provide additional help. It might even be the case that the company's whole network is down, in which case you just have to wait it out.
