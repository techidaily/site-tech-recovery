 Can’t access the internet while out and about on your Android phone? There’s a good chance a setting misconfiguration is causing the problem. We’ll show you how to fix that and a few other items to restore mobile data connectivity on your phone.

 The steps to follow can vary depending on the phone model you use. The steps in this guide are from a Samsung Galaxy phone, but the same general concepts should apply to other Android devices.

##  Set the Correct SIM for Mobile Data

 If your phone supports dual [SIM](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-superior-video-editing-software-for-online-sessions/), ensure you’ve selected the correct SIM for mobile data. This is because Android allows you to choose which SIM you want to use to access the internet. The SIM card with no internet plan may be selected here.

 To fix that, launch Settings on your phone and select "Connections." Choose "SIM Manager" and select "Mobile Data." Then, select the SIM that has an internet plan to use it for internet access on your phone.

Close 

 Wait a few seconds, and your phone should have internet access.

##  Make Sure You Haven't Exceeded Your Mobile Data Limit

 If you’re on a limited internet data plan, [ensure you haven’t exceeded the allowed data limit](https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/how-to-get-the-brightness-control-back-in-working-order-on-windows-11/). Some carriers allow you to continue using the internet at a fee even after you’ve used up the allowed data, while others forbid internet access.

 Check your account with your carrier and see what the limit is and if you’re over that limit. If you aren’t sure how to access your account details, check out your carrier (like [AT&T](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003858/https://www.att.com/support/contact-us/), [Verizon](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003858/https://www.verizon.com/support/contact-us/), [T-Mobile](https://www.t-mobile.com/contact-us), and so on)’s website to find their contact details.

##  Turn Off the Wi-Fi on Your Phone

 If you’ve enabled Wi-Fi on your phone, turn it off and see if cellular data works. This is because your phone might be switching between Wi-Fi and mobile data to find and use the best internet route.

 To disable Wi-Fi, pull down twice from the top of your phone’s screen and tap the Wi-Fi icon. Then, check if your mobile data works. Later, you can re-enable Wi-Fi by pulling down twice from the top of your phone’s screen and tapping the same Wi-Fi icon.

##  Toggle Mobile Data Off and On

 Disabling and re-enabling mobile data sometimes helps fix minor glitches. This gives your phone a fresh chance to re-establish an internet link.

 To do this, open Settings and tap "Connections." Select "Data Usage" to access data-related options. On the following screen, turn off the "Mobile Data" toggle. This disables cellular data.

Close 

 Wait for about ten seconds and turn the "Mobile Data" toggle back on. Your phone should now be connected to the internet.

##  Enable and Disable Airplane Mode

 Turning on [airplane mode](https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-cutting-edge-audio-tools-for-iphone-and-ipad-enthusiasts/) disconnects and re-connects your phone to all the networks. This includes Wi-Fi as well as cellular networks. This is a good troubleshooting tip to use when your phone has trouble accessing the internet or making phone calls.

 To do this, pull down twice from the top of your phone’s screen and tap the flight icon. This puts your phone on airplane mode. Wait for about five seconds and tap the same flight icon again. You’ve now disabled airplane mode.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  Deactivate and Reactivate the SIM Card

 Deactivating and re-activating the SIM card with internet access helps fix minor SIM problems. This is equal to physically taking out the SIM card and putting it back in.

 To do this, open Settings and select "Connections." Choose "SIM Manager" to view SIM settings. Next to the SIM card that you use for the internet, turn off the toggle. This disables the chosen SIM card on your phone.

 This method doesn’t deactivate your SIM card from its carrier. Your SIM card continues to work as usual; it’s just that the card is temporarily deactivated on your phone.

Close 

 In the prompt, select "OK." Wait for about ten seconds and turn on the toggle for your SIM card.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  Manually Choose the Network Provider

 By default, Android automatically chooses the suitable carrier for the inserted SIM card. However, when you have trouble using the internet, choose your carrier manually.

 Do that by opening Settings and tapping "Connections." Then, select "Mobile Networks." Turn off the "Select Automatically" toggle so your phone doesn’t choose a network automatically.

Close 

 Wait a while, and you’ll see available networks. Select the suitable network on the list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##  Reset Your Phone's Network Settings

 If nothing else works, your phone’s network settings might be faulty. Resetting these settings can help fix the problem. Doing so erases the saved Wi-Fi networks and paired Bluetooth devices, but you can always re-connect to those items.

 To [reset the network settings](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-best-smart-speaker-for-melody-lovers-the-nest-audio-assessment/), open Settings and select General Management > Reset. Choose "Reset Network Settings" and select "Reset Settings."

Close 

 Confirm the action by tapping "Reset." Then, see if mobile data works.

---

 And that’s how you restore your Android phone’s cellular internet connectivity. Hopefully, at least. If all else fails, you may need to [perform a factory reset on your phone](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-get-the-apple-id-verification-code-from-apple-iphone-14-in-the-best-ways-by-drfone-ios/). Good luck!
