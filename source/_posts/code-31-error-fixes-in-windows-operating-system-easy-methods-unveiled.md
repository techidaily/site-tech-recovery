## Code 31 Error Fixes in Windows Operating System - Easy Methods Unveiled
 The Code 31 error could apply to any hardware device in Device Manager, but most Code 31 errors appear on [optical drives](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-optical-disc-drive-2618157) , such as CD and DVD drives.

 Any of Microsoft's operating systems could experience a Code 31 Device Manager error including Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, and more.

## How to Fix a Code 31 Error

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't done so already. The Code 31 error could source from a temporary memory glitch.
2. Did you install a device or make a change in Device Manager just before the Code 31 error appeared? If so, it's possible that the change you made caused the Code 31 error.  
 Undo the change if you can, restart your PC, and then check again for the Code 31 error.
3. [Roll back the driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) to a version prior to your updates.
4. [Use System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) to undo recent Device Manager-related changes.
5. [Delete the UpperFilters and LowerFilters registry values](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-delete-the-upperfilters-and-lowerfilters-registry-values-2619222) . A common cause of Code 31 errors is the corruption of two[registry values](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-value-2626042) in the DVD/CD-ROM Drive Class[registry key](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) .  
 Deleting similar values in the [Windows Registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) could also be the solution to a Code 31 error that appears on a device other than a DVD or CD drive. The UpperFilters/LowerFilters tutorial linked above will show you exactly what you need to do.  
 Some people have had luck deleting the _entire key_ that holds the UpperFilters and LowerFilters values. If deleting the specific values doesn't fix the Code 31 error, try [backing up the registry key](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-back-up-the-windows-registry-2625146) you identify in that tutorial above, and then [delete the registry key](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-add-change-delete-registry-keys-values-2625145) , reboot, [restore the registry key from the backup](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-the-windows-registry-2625148) , and reboot again.
6. [Update the drivers for the device](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . Installing the latest manufacturer supplied drivers for a device with the Code 31 error is a likely fix for this problem.
7. Reinstall the Microsoft ISATAP network adapter if the Code 31 error is related to the MS ISATAP adapter not working properly.  
[Open Device Manager](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-device-manager-2626075) and access the**Action** \>**Add legacy hardware** screen. Start the wizard and select **Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)** . Click through the steps and choose **Network adapters** \>**Microsoft** \>**Microsoft ISATAP Adapter** from the list.
8. Replace the hardware. As a last resort, you might need to replace the hardware that has the Code 31 error.  
 It's also possible that the device is not compatible with this version of Windows. Check the[Windows Hardware Compatibility List](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-windows-hardware-compatibility-list-2625914) to be sure.  
 If you're convinced that hardware isn't the cause of this particular Code 31 error, you could try to[automatically repair Windows problems](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If that doesn't work, try a[clean install of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . We don't recommend doing either of those_before_ you try replacing the hardware, but you may have to give them a shot if you're out of other options.
