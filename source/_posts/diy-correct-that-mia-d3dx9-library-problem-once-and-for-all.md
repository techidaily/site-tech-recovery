## DIY: Correct That MIA D3DX9 Library Problem Once and For All
 The d3dx9\_26.dll file is one of a number of files contained within DirectX. Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows-based games and advanced graphics programs, errors related to this file usually show up only when using these programs.

 Any of Microsoft's operating systems since Windows 98 may be affected by d3dx9\_26.dll and other DirectX issues. This includes Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, etc.

## How to Fix D3dx9\_26.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Don't download d3dx9\_26.dll individually from any "DLL download site". There are a number of reasons why[downloading DLLs from these sites is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already done so, remove it from whatever folder you copied it to and then continue with these steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet done so.  
 The d3dx9\_26.dll error might be a fluke or one-time issue, and a simple restart could clear it up completely. It's unlikely this will fix the problem, but restarting is always a good first troubleshooting step.  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Install DirectX Redist (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) . This includes the d3dx9\_26.dll file and should therefore fix the not found error.  
 If installing the DirectX End-User Runtime doesn't fix the error, use a[file extractor tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-unzip-programs-1356643) to extract the contents of the download you obtained through that link above. You should then find a CAB file that you can unzip as well, and in there is the DLL file. Copy it wherever the error says it's missing from.
3. If the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't help, look for a DirectX installation program on your game/app disc. Usually, if it utilizes DirectX, the software developers will include a copy of it on the installation disc.  
 Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc works better with the software program than the latest version available online.
4. [Uninstall and then reinstall](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) the game or software program. Something may have happened to the files in the program that work with d3dx9\_26.dll, and a reinstallation could do the trick.
5. [Restore the file from the latest DirectX package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above steps haven't worked to correct your d3dx9\_26.dll error, try extracting the file individually from the DirectX package.
6. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for your video card. While it's not the most common solution, in some situations updating the drivers for the video card in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.

![D3dx9_26 DLL Error Message in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/noqTWlWE0sNGoO5Puo30C8A_csY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/d3dx9-26-dll-error-message-0566a9f187df4fe39cf967d87d5106f4.png)

 Unlike many other[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) errors which can have complicated causes and fixes, d3dx9\_26.dll issues are caused in one way or another by a single issue: a problem of some sort with Microsoft DirectX.

 There are quite a few ways d3dx9\_26.dll errors may show up on your computer. Here are some of the more common error messages:

* **D3DX9\_26.DLL Not Found**
* **File d3dx9\_26.dll not found**
* **The dynamic link library d3dx9\_26.dll could not be found in the specified path \[PATH\]**
* **The file d3dx9\_26.dll is missing**
* **D3DX9\_26.DLL is missing. Replace D3DX9\_26.DLL and try again**
* **D3dx9\_26.dll - Unable to Locate Component**
* **This application has failed to start because d3dx9\_26.dll could not be found**
* **The program can't start because D3DX9\_26.DLL is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.**

 These errors typically appear when a software program, usually a game or graphics program, is started. In non-game applications, the error might appear before certain advanced graphics features of the program are used.

 However, considering that d3dx9\_26.dll error messages could apply to any program that utilizes Microsoft DirectX, they're commonly seen in video games. These have been known to generate related errors:_Civilization IV, Autodesk 3ds Max, Need for Speed: Most Wanted_ , pSX Emulator (a Sony Playstation emulator), and more.
