## Boost Your Surround-Sound Experience by Connecting Various Bluetooth Speakers to Just One Source
 With the proliferation of smart speakers, such as Amazon Echo and Google Home, there are more Bluetooth devices in homes than ever. To get audio to multiple speakers, use an app such as AmpMe, Bose Connect, or a few from Ultimate Ears, as well as[Bluetooth 5](https://www.lifewire.com/bluetooth-5-4160255) , which send audio to two devices at once.

 Instructions in this article apply to Bluetooth speakers connected to Android, Amazon Echo, or Google Home devices.

## Use AmpMe to Connect Multiple Bluetooth Speakers

 There are a few apps that connect multiple Bluetooth devices, including AmpMe, Bose Connect, and Ultimate Ears. AmpMe is the most versatile, as it's not brand-specific, while the Bose and Ultimate Ears apps require the respective company's Bluetooth speakers.

 AmpMe syncs smartphones and Bluetooth speakers together to stream audio from SoundCloud, YouTube, or your media library. Users can create or join parties on any of these platforms, and sync with unlimited devices. ([Visit AmpMe's website](https://www.ampme.com/) to learn more about the app's features.)

 Your smartphone can only connect to one speaker, so you'll need participation from friends and family to make it work.

 The person who creates the party controls the music, but other users can send song requests using the app's chat feature. The host can also turn on the**Guest as DJ** feature, which lets other participants add songs to the queue.

 After you download the app, link it to either your Facebook or Google account, then see if any of your contacts are on AmpMe, or turn on location services and find a party near you.

 To start a party:

1. Tap the**+** (Plus) sign.
2. Select the service, then tap**Connect**  
![Starting a party in Ampme](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0yjBf9mf5GLyg5M0cCg79ixVLa0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/startingAmpmeparty-8ebf33c5680d473ca458ff33fe904513.jpg)
3. Log in to your account.
4. Choose or create a playlist.  
![Connecting and logging into a Spotify account](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/MMgPi9SRCkLINE3_u9QOVC8reiA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/004-how-to-connect-multiple-bluetooth-speakers-to-one-device-fdd808ec682943f7ad644642981de3e9-58050f8efd4b49d48f1036207bdc9a62.jpg)

 Invite people to your party who can join remotely, or invite them over.

## Use Audio Company Apps to Connect Multiple Bluetooth Speakers

 With the Bose Connect and Ultimate Ears apps, you can pair a smartphone with multiple speakers, but only on particular models.

* **Bose Connect:** This app works with Bose speakers and headphones, and a Party Mode feature streams audio to two headphones or two speakers at once.[Download Bose Connect for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/bose-connect/id1046510029) or[get the Android Bose Connect app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bose.monet) ; the app pages list compatible devices.
* **Ultimate Ears** : The[Ultimate Ears Boom app](https://www.ultimateears.com/features/apps.html) has a feature called PartyUp that connects and streams music to over 150 speakersâ€”excluding the Wonderboom, Blast, and Megablast models.

## Use Samsung's Dual Audio Feature

 If you have a Samsung Galaxy S8, S+, or newer model, take advantage of the company's Bluetooth Dual Audio, which works with most Bluetooth speakers and headphones; Bluetooth 5 isn't required.

![Samsung Dual Audio menu option in Android Oreo](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/d75r_x1ppHs_RizFNh3iAdh9UaM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/SamsungDualAudio-5babcd3746e0fb002586ac64.jpg)

Samsung

 In earlier Android versions, tap the**three-dot menu** in the upper-right corner.
3. Turn on the**Dual Audio** toggle switch.

4. To use Dual Audio, pair the phone with two speakers, two headphones, or one of each, and audio will stream to both.

 If you add a third speaker, the first paired device will be booted off.

 If you link your Samsung with two sets of headphones, only the first connected device can manage playback using on-headphone media controls. You may also encounter Bluetooth speakers that are out of sync, so this feature is best for speakers located in separate rooms.
