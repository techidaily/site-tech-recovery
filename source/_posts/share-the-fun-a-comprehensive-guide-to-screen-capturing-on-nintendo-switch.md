##  How to Take a Screenshot on Nintendo Switch 

 Taking a screenshot is super easy with the Nintendo Switch, provided you know what button to press: 

* **On the Joy-Con controller** : The left Joy-Con has a dedicated screenshot button. It's square and located near the bottom of the controller, underneath the directional buttons.
* **On a Pro Controller** : The screenshot button is located just left of the center of the controller, above the directional pad.

 Once you've pressed the screenshot button on either controller, you'll hear a camera shutter sound and a notification will pop up in the top left of your Switch's screen stating "Capture Taken."

##  How to View Your Screenshots on the Nintendo Switch 

 All of your screenshots can be found in the Nintendo Switch's Album App. To view your screenshots, select the**Album** icon (looks like a box with a sideways heat) at the bottom of the Switch's Home Screen.

![Nintendo Switch menu with Album icon highlighted](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0scsqhdtsDWWhch7A2fBE4vhorA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/AlbumIcon-daad21bac77a4c01ab38c9eb76d033d4.jpg) 

 If you have many screenshots, you can filter them within the album so it's easier to look through. Tap**Filter** or press the**Y** button, then select which filter you want to use. You can choose to look at:

* Screenshots Only
* Videos Only
* System Memory: Images stored on the Switch itself
* MicroSD Card: Images stored on your Switch's removable microSD card
* Specific Game Screenshots: So you can browse according to the game you played.

##  How to Copy a Screenshot to a MicroSD Card 

 Sometimes, you might want to move your screenshots to a microSD card rather than leave it on your console. This is useful because you can remove the microSD card and place it into your PC or laptop, like you can with a digital camera's memory card.

1. When browsing your Switch's album, select the screenshot you want to move.
2. Tap**Editing and Posting** .
3. Select**Copy** .
4. Select**Copy** again.
5. Select**OK** .
6. You now have two copies of that screenshot. One on your Switch and one on the microSD card.  
 Want to delete one of those copies? In the Album, tap**Delete** (or press X), then select each image. Select**Delete** to delete the images you've selected.
