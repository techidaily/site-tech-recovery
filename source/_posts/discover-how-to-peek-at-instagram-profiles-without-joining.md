##  How to See Instagram Profiles Without an Account

 It's possible to see Instagram profiles and photos without logging in. To do it, all you need to know is the name of the profile you wish to view. Here's what to do:  

1. Open this URL in a web browser, but change the**username** portion to the username of the profile in question:  
 `https://www.instagram.com/username`  
 For example, to open Lifewire's Instagram account, you'd go to**instagram.com/lifewiretech** .

2. To view a photo or video, right-click it and select**Open link in new tab** .

3. You can now view the image or select the video to play it. Comments are also visible even when you're not logged in.

##  Use Imginn to Search Instagram Without an Account

 Instagram doesn't let you search for users unless you log in first. One workaround is to use a third-party website. One of the most effective is Imginn, which has the added bonus of letting you[ download content from Instagram](https://www.lifewire.com/save-instagram-photos-4125398) without logging in. Here's how it works:  

1. [ Visit Imginn](https://imginn.com/) in any web browser.
2. Use the search bar to enter some information about the profile to find the username.

3. When you find the person you're searching for, select their profile image.

##  What You Can Do on Instagram Without an Account

 Viewing Instagram without an account is possible, but quite limited. Here's what you can do when you use Instagram without logging in:  

* **View profiles.** If you know the profile name, you can check the user's profile information as well as see any links they may have in their bio.
* **View images and videos.** You can click an image or video to see the content.
* **See comments.** It's possible to read comments left by registered users.
* **Browse anonymously.** Instagram's algorithm means it can suggest related accounts based on what you've looked at. When not logged in, your activity isn't being tracked.

 FAQ

* How do I view private Instagram profiles?  
 The only way to see a private Instagram profile is if you send the owner a follow request, and they accept it. Only accepted followers or people who were already following when an account became private can see its contents.
* How do I view an Instagram Story anonymously?  
 You must be logged in to see Instagram Stories. Some sites and apps claim to let you download old Stories without being logged in, but you should be skeptical of these, especially if they ask for your password.
