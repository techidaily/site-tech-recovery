## How to Sign up for the Tidal Student Discount

 If you qualify for a student discount, you can sign up for the discount in a similar manner as a traditional membership to the music streaming service.

 Most other streaming music services offer student discounts as well, like[Spotify](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829) and[Apple Music](https://www.lifewire.com/everything-to-know-apple-music-1999485) , but Tidal offers something the others don't: HiFi and Master quality sound from an online streaming service.

1. Visit the[Tidal login page](https://listen.tidal.com/login) and enter an email or social media account to start creating a profile.
2. Once you've signed in, you can select which account type you'd like, including Individual, Family, or Student.
3. Select**Student** , and complete the signup process by entering your payment information.

## How to Verify You’re a Student

 Once you've signed up as a student, you'll need to upload documents to prove you're a student through SheerID. Your information remains private and isn't shared outside the verification process.

1. After signing up for a Tidal account, fill in required information about your school and other details, and press**Continue** .
2. You then need to provide a document showing your first and last name and school name.  
 Example documents include: an enrollment letter, current class schedule, transcript, or a registration or tuition receipt. You may provide more than one document if necessary.
3. Select**Choose File.** Then, navigate to and select the document you want to use to verify your student status.

4. Once you've attached the document, press**Next** , and a confirmation page appears stating an email will be sent when your verification is confirmed for the Tidal student discount.  
You must reverify your student status every 12 months.

## Understanding the Tidal for Students Fine Print

 While the SheerID says it won't rent or share your information and only uses it to verify details on behalf of Tidal, it also recommends you still cover sensitive information.

 On the submitting page it says:

> We strongly suggest covering up or redacting all sensitive information on documentation before uploading it into our system.

 While an official enrollment letter from your academic institution is okay, SheerID says acceptance letters will not be approved. Beyond the listed forms of valid documents above to prove your student status, these are also acceptable:

* School ID card with an expiration date
* Official letters

## Who Qualifies for a Tidal Student Discount?

 To get a student discount through Tidal, you must meet the following criteria:

* Be at least 16 year old
* Attend an eligible U.S. high school or college

 While there are lots of classifications of students and schools, the Tidal discount doesn't extend to every circumstance. Tidal uses a similar process as Spotify and works with a company called SheerID to help verify students for various promotions.
