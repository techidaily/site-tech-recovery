## Removing User Pin Authentication From Windows 10 – Easy Instructions Inside
### What to Know

* Be sure you've signed in to the account you want to remove the PIN from before you begin.
* Go to**Start** \>**Settings** \>**Accounts** \>**Sign-in options** \>**Windows Hello PIN** \>**Remove** \>**Remove** .
* Once the PIN is gone, consider protecting your account by other means, like a password.

 This article covers how to remove a PIN in Windows 10\. PINs are an optional way to sign in, much like a password, alongside other options like fingerprint and face authentication.

 If you have kids, roommates, or a work device, it's usually best to keep a lock on your user account, but if it's just you at home, how you sign in likely doesn't matter. So, if convenience is a priority, you can go without a password and not be at risk.

## How Do I Disable the PIN in Windows 10?

 Like setting a PIN in Windows, removing one takes only a few clicks and seconds. Ensure you've signed in to the account you want to remove the PIN from before you begin.

1. Open the**Start menu** and select**Settings** .

## Windows 10 PIN Tips and Tricks

 If you change your mind and want a PIN again, making one is just as easy. From the same place where you chose**Remove** ,**you can now** select**Add** . Set and confirm your PIN to be prompted for it the next time you sign in. In the future, select**Change** instead to make a new PIN.

 The**Sign-in options** page also allows you to sign in to your device in various ways, including a traditional password. From this window, you can easily adjust all your sign-in needs.

Any sign-in method you choose, even if you linked your computer to your Microsoft account, will apply only to your computer and not your Microsoft account.
