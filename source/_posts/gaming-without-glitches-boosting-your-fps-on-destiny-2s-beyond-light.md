## Fix 1: Disable NVIDIA reflex

 NVIDIA Reflex uses GPU power to increase system responsiveness and decrease input latency. But it will sacrifice you a bunch of FPS. It’s turned on by default in the game. To turn it off, you need to set the value to 0\. Here’s how you can do this:

1) Exit your game.

2) In the search bar, copy and paste**%appdata%BungieDestinyPCprefs** .

3) Right-click on the**cvar.xml** file and select**Open with > Editor/ Notepad** .

4) Scroll down and find this line **<cvar name=”low\_latency\_mode” value=”1″ />** . Now you need to change the value to**0** .

 Once done, click on**File > Save** to save the changes.  
  
![disable NVIDIA Reflex change the value to 0 to fix Beyond Light FPS drops issue](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/save-the-cvar-xlm-file.png)

 Now relaunch your game to check if it works. If you still get low FPS, you can delete that**cvars.xml** file.

## Fix 2: Verify the integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of game files is a recommended troubleshooting step you should take when you’re faced with game bugs. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files is intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or corrupted files. Here’s how you can do this:

1) Launch your Steam client.

2) From the**LIBRARY** section, right-click**Destiny 2: Beyond Light** and select**Properties** from the menu.

3) When the Properties window opens, select the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click the**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** tab. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes. Once complete, restart your game and check if it helps you improve your performance.

## Fix 3: Update your video card driver

 Your device drivers, the video card driver, in particular, are important components that greatly impact your computer’s performance. If you get low FPS when gaming, one of the recommended troubleshooting steps you should take is to update your video card driver especially if you can’t remember when was the last time you had it updated.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your video card driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Fix 4: Turn off hardware acceleration

 By default, hardware acceleration is enabled in Chrome and Discord. This feature utilizes your computer’s GPU to tackle graphics-intensive tasks. But it can cause your computer’s battery to drain a lot faster. And when you have pretty low FPS in the game, hardware acceleration could be the culprit. In this case, you need to turn off hardware acceleration in Chrome and Discord.

### In Chrome

 1) At the top right, click on the three lines and then select**Settings** .  
  
![disable hardware acceleration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/disable-hardware-acceleration-Google-Chrome.png)

 2) Scroll down to the bottom and click on**Advanced** .  
  
![disable hardware acceleration Google Chrome](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/advanced-disable-hardware-acceleration-Google-Chrome.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Scroll down to the**System** section, and toggle off the option**Use hardware acceleration when available** . Then click**Relaunch** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### In Discord

 1) Open the Discord app. Click on **Settings** (the gear icon beside your avatar).  
  
![open Discord settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Discord-settings-2.jpg)

 2) On the left pane, navigate to**Appearance** . In this tab, scroll down to the**ADVANCED** section and toggle off the option**Hardware Acceleration** .  
  
![disable hardware acceleration Discord](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Discord-disable-hardware-acceleration.png)

 After turning off hardware acceleration, try and play your game to check if it mitigates your issue.

## Fix 5: Temporarily disable background programs

 Ideally, we suggest you close programs that may be using the internet and system resources. It’s also a great way to make sure that no third-party programs are interfering with your game. To disable programs running in the background, take these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Type **msconfig**  and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Go to the **Services**  tab. Check **Hide all Microsoft services** and click **Disable all** .
