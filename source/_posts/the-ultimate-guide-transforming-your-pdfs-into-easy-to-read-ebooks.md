At the beginning of e-reading waves, we used to think .txt, .chm and .PDF are the formats we can call them "eBook". Later the .txt and .chm are eliminated from the team while .PDF remains until now.

With the blooming of eBooks industry, now we get more formats available for an eBook, such as .epub, .azw, .mobi. These formats have better adaptation for reading gadgets, and the secure issue, which is the biggest advantage of PDF file, is not that important for just reading an eBook.

What's more, the eBook resellers are also abandoning PDF format, at the moment we can rarely get an eBook in PDF format from popular online stores like Amazon, Sony, Kobo, etc.. 

we recommend that you avoid the pdf format whenever possible, unless your document has been specifically formatted for your Cybook and your personal preferences (texte size, choice of font…) since the inherent rigidity of this format will never allow a completely personnalised display.

EPUB is the ideal format for ebooks. For an optimal reading experience, we strongly recommend you choose EPUB whenever possible.

And for all the Kindle users who cannot read EPUB on their devices, I will also not recommend PDF, .mobi or .azw are definitely better for Kindles.

In this article, I am going to introduce how to convert (protected) PDF to eBook.

### Some basic knowledge for converting PDF to eBook

1\. Not all the PDF files can be perfectly converted to eBook.

2\. Don't ever try to convert a scanned PDF to eBook.

3\. PDF with lots of images, formulas, and special patterns (for example, text books) can hardly get a satisfying conversion result, the layout would mess up and the special patterns might be lost.

4\. Before converting your PDF file to eBook, you can [edit PDF by yourself](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

5\. PDF protected by Adobe DRM (from Sony, Kobo, Google), Kindle DRM (from Amazon), Nook DRM (from B&N) can be converted with this guide. Apple iBooks are not supported.

6\. Kindle users please **convert PDF to mobi**, all the other e-Reader devices uers please convert PDF to EPUB.

This article is very good. PDF is not a good format for books; it is mainly for documented information. I have downloaded so many PDFs that are formatted two pages to a screen, and you have to read half the screen and then go back up and read the other half. It is not a positive experience. I am glad this option is available now.
