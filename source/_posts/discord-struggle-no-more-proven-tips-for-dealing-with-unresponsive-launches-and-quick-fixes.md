 Is the game working normally now? Or is it still unplayable? If the latter, try the next fix below.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 The Battlefield 5 not launching issue may occur if you’re using a faulty graphics driver or it’s out-of-date. We’d recommend you check for the driver update regularly, which can not only prevent gaming problems but also help you enjoy a smooth playful experience.

To update your graphics driver, here are two safe ways for you:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/de-1-7.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DBanner%2B728x90"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/2e76fe6a-3010-1b37-7846-f34ff9c6b4ca.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

### Fix 4 – Turn off Origin in-game overlay

 Origin enables the in-game overlay feature by default, but that may cause Battlefield 5 not starting properly. Try disabling this option to see if the problem is fixed.

1. Launch your Origin desktop client.
2. Click**Origin** on the top pane and click**Application Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-1-2.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Origin In-Game** tab, and toggle off**Enable Origin In-Game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-2-3.jpg)

 Relaunch the game to test this method. If it doesn’t help, continue to the next one below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5 – Disable cloud storage

 If your save file is corrupted, Battlefield 5 won’t launch neither. And a simple workaround towards this is to disable the cloud storage in Origin.

1. Open the Origin client.
2. Click**Origin** \>**Applications Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-1-2.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Installs & Saves** tab, and then toggle off**Saves** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-2-3.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to invoke File Explorer. Then, select**Document** from the left pane.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
5. Rename your**Battlefield V** folder to Battlefield V backup or anything else.

 Check whether you can get into Battlefield 5 or not. If this method is of no avail, restore the folder’s name and try the last fix.

### Fix 6 – Perform a reinstallation

 A fresh reinstallation is a common but solid fix to constant program problems. So, if all else above can’t get your Battlefield V back to life, try to reinstall the game completely.

1. Run the Origin client.
2. Select**My Game Library** on the left pane.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-1.jpg)
3. Right-click the**Battlefield 5** tile from the list, and click**Uninstall** .
