## Who is Eligible For the Dell Student Discount?

 UNiDAYS has a couple of requirements that you need to meet if you want to take advantage of their Dell student discount codes. To qualify for this discount, you must be:

* Over 16 years old.
* Currently enrolled at a college or university.
* Access to either a[.edu email](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-get-an-edu-email-4628279) issued by your school, or a credit card style student ID from your school.

 Parents can't sign up for their children, so students younger than 17 are unable to use this discount even if they are enrolled at a qualifying school.

## What Does the Dell Student Discount Get You?

 The Dell student discount typically provides a 10 percent discount on Dell products, in addition to whatever other deals Dell may be running at the time. This amount can change, so make sure to check UNiDAYS to see what the current offer is before making a decision.

 Coupon codes are generated through UNiDAYS and then applied in the shopping cart on Dell's site after verifying that you are a student. That means you will not see the discount reflected in prices on the Dell website prior to checkout.

## How Does Dell Verify Student Enrollment?

 Dell student discount coupon codes are available through UNiDAYS, which verifies your enrollment as a student. This service is able to verify enrollment at most four-year universities and colleges, and manual verification is available for many schools that aren't already in the system.

 This same service is used by many other big companies, so signing up once can grant you access to a variety of student discounts from companies other than Dell.
