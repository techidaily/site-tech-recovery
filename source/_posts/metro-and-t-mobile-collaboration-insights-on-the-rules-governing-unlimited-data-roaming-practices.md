## Metro and T-Mobile Collaboration: Insights on the Rules Governing Unlimited Data Roaming Practices
 Like most major wireless carriers in the U.S., Metro by T-Mobile (formerly MetroPCS) no longer charges a per-minute roaming fee on domestic accounts. Instead, Metro by T-Mobile service spans the entire[nationwide T-Mobile network](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/coverage/coverage-map) . If you end up somewhere that's not in the company's coverage area, you're automatically switched to a T-Mobile carrier partner's network, so you'll get connectivity outside the T-Mobile network.

 Even with no per-minute roaming fees, you may experience restricted or slowed service, or a suspension, if you run up excessive out-of-zone phone time. It's a good idea to make sure Metro by T-Mobile's coverage areas align with where you use your phone most of the time.

## Metro by T-Mobile Services

 Metro by T-Mobile offers several domestic service packages, none of which incur per-minute roaming charges in the nationwide coverage area or on the networks of T-Mobile partners.

 Metro by T-Mobile plans don't require a contract, so it's easy to switch to a plan that makes more sense for you and your family.[Popular Metro by T-Mobile plans](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/phone-plans) include a 10 GB plan for $40 per month and an unlimited data plan for $50 per month (you get discounts when you add lines).

## International Roaming

 While you won't experience per-minute roaming fees in the nationwide coverage area with Metro by T-Mobile plans, you may incur roaming charges when you travel internationally. International roaming is possible with Metro by T-Mobile because of partner agreements between T-Mobile and some international carriers. International roaming fees vary, and fees can quickly add up.

 See[Metro by T-Mobile's Terms of Service International Roaming](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/terms-and-conditions/international-roaming) for specific information about the Metro by T-Mobile international roaming program.

## Avoid Roaming Charges With Global Voice

 If you're a frequent international traveler, consider Metro by T-Mobile's[$10 per month Global Voice](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/shop/services) add-on.

 Global Voice gets you 200 talk minutes while in select countries and the ability to receive unlimited text messages. You'll also be able to send up to 200 text messages and use 200 MB of data in select countries. When you're in the U.S., Global Voice allows you to call landlines in more than 75 countries and send texts to friends in most countries globally.

 To find out if a country is covered by Metro by T-Mobile's Global Voice add-on, visit[Metro by T-Mobile's international services page](https://www.metrobyt-mobile.com/shop/services/international) and choose your country from the drop-down list.

 If you're in frequent contact with people in Mexico, Metro by T-Mobile offers a Mexico and Canada Unlimited add-on with unlimited talk and text to and from those countries, along with 5 GB of data roaming. This add-on is $5 per month.
