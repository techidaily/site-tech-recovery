## How the 0x80070570 Error Code Appears

 This message usually appears when an error occurs during the initial installation of a Windows operating system or during the update of one that's already installed. The 0x80070570 error message has also been known to appear while moving files from one drive to another.

## Cause of Error Code 0x80070570

 A missing or corrupted file usually triggers an appearance of the 0x80070570 error code. A damaged or faulty drive can also cause the 0x80070570 message to appear, as this can prevent your[Windows computer](https://www.lifewire.com/brief-history-of-microsoft-windows-3507078) from reading the required files correctly.

 When the error message appears during a Windows operating system installation or upgrade, the cause is typically a corrupted installation file that problems on the server side of the download or an unstable or weak internet connection on your side may have created.

## How to Fix 0x80070570 Error

 Because the cause of an 0x80070570 error can be challenging to pinpoint, it's worth working through these potential solutions until the problem is resolved.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) . Restarting a computer often fixes random tech problems and should be the first thing you try.  
 Before restarting your computer, save all your open files and quit any open apps or programs. This way, you won't lose any progress or content.
2. [Perform a Windows update](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . In addition to giving you access to the latest Windows features and security improvements, the Windows update process also performs a system-wide scan and fixes glitches and bugs.
3. Re-download the Windows update. If the 0x80070570 error appeared during the Windows update process, restart your computer and manually force a Windows update. To do so, select**Start Menu** \>**Settings** \>**Update & Security** \>**Check for update** .  
 When performing the Windows update again, avoid using apps or programs that require access to the internet so the connection is the strongest it can be. If you're on a[metered connection](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-a-windows-10-metered-connection-4584369) , consider switching to a faster Wi-Fi or wired connection for a stable download experience.
4. Retry the app installation. Similar to the above advice, sometimes retrying a[Windows 10 app update](https://www.lifewire.com/update-apps-windows-4684685) or installation will work, so it's worth trying at least a second or third time before looking for an alternative fix.
5. [Check the disk for damage](https://www.lifewire.com/free-disk-scanning-software-2438358) . If you're installing software from a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disk, check the disk for damage or dirt. A scratched or grimy disk can make it difficult for a disk drive to read its contents and can trigger the 0x80070570 alert.  
 When[cleaning a dirty disk](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-dvds-blu-rays-and-video-games-1387925) , avoid making circular motions with the cloth. There are a[variety of ways to repair a scratched disk](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-a-scratched-cd-4684544) .
6. Download the file again. If you get the 0x80070570 error after opening a downloaded file, it may be corrupted or incomplete. Download it again and make sure the download completes.  
 An easy way to check if a file has downloaded completely is to check its size. Many websites list the total size of the files available for download. To cross-reference this with the downloaded file, right-click its icon on your computer, then select**Properties** .
7. Check official channels. Sometimes apps and video game developers release installation files that are corrupted or not uploaded properly. Usually, the associated individuals or companies post about these occurrences on their official social media accounts. If so, wait until a fixed installation file is published.
8. [Check your hard drive for errors](https://www.lifewire.com/check-and-fix-hard-drive-errors-3506860) . Sometimes a damaged drive can be behind a 0x80070570 error message.  
 Use this method to scan local drives and external drives or storage devices connected to your computer from a USB port.
9. Ask for a new copy. If the file was sent to you from someone else in an email and you can't open it due to the 0x80070570 error message, ask the sender to re-upload it to a new email and send it to you again.  
 When doing this, ask the sender not to resend the same email but to manually re-upload the attachment. The file was likely corrupted the first time it was uploaded.
10. Quit the app. If you have trouble opening a file you downloaded from an app such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Line, or[Facebook Messenger](https://www.lifewire.com/facebook-messenger-4103719) , quit the app, restart your computer, open the app, and download the file again.
