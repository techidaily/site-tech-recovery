That's all I want to share with you. Hope this can work for you. By the way, the one thing I have to point out is the plugin can only import DRM free Kindle or EPUB eBooks, if you need to convert DRM protected eBooks, you can use the all-in-one software[Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), which can help you convert both DRM free and DRM protected eBooks formats.
