## Connect & Share: A Beginner's Guide to Viewing Netflix with Others Online

Close 

###  What to Know

* To watch Netflix with friends, install Rave, log in with your Netflix account, and send friends the unique invite link.
* Each screen share participant will need to install Rave on their device and have a Netflix account.
* Teleparty and Discord are popular Netflix screen share alternatives.

 While it’s possible to simply get everyone in your group to hit the play button at the same time, there are now much smarter ways to watch Netflix with friends that automatically sync the show or movie that’s playing while allowing everyone to communicate via a text or voice chat.

 This guide will walk you through the steps for one of the best methods to screen share Netflix with friends and family while also including some additional information on some alternative methods.

##  How Can I Screen Share Netflix? 

 There are a number of apps and extensions for screen sharing Netflix, though most of them are restricted to a single type of device that can limit who can participate. Rave fixes this problem by providing completely free stand-alone apps for Macs and Windows computers in addition to iOS and Android smart devices.

[ Download Rave ](https://rave.io) 

 Here’s how to use Rave to watch Netflix with others at the same time.

 These instructions show how to begin a Netflix screen share on a Windows computer and then join in from an iPhone but the process can be repeated from any device with Rave installed. The steps are identical no matter what you’re using.

1. After downloading and installing Rave, open the app on your device.
2. Log into Rave by selecting either your Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), or Google account.
