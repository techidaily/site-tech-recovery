## OnePlus 10 Features

[OnePlus details new video shooting features](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/diving-deep-into-the-oneplus-10-pro-camera.1554663/) in the OnePlus 10 Pro, including one called Movie Mode. "By allowing you to adjust parameters such as white balance, shutter speed, and ISO before and during video capture, this mode gives you full control over your creative process." The company says this mode lets you opt into capturing in LOG format, which is said to make it easier for videographers to color grade their footage.

 There's also a neat Dual-View Video feature that lets you record from both the front and back-facing cameras simultaneouslyâ€”this is great for capturing your reaction during vlogs. Another feature is Extended Exposure, which lets you capture long exposure shots even if you don't have a tripod.

 More details about this phone's specs are below. It has better battery life than the OnePlus 9, the latest OxygenOS operating system, and a new PRO mode for RAW imaging formats.

 YouTuber Marques Brownlee provides a first look:
