## Step-by-Step Fix for the dnssd.dll Cannot Be Found Issue
 Dnssd.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the dnssd [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, dnssd.dll errors could indicate a [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

## How to Fix Dnssd.dll Errors

 Do not download dnssd.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of dnssd.dll, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

 Follow these steps in the order they're presented to try the easier solutions first.

1. [Restore dnssd.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" dnssd.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect that you've accidentally deleted this file, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover dnssd.dll with a free[file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . Just make sure it wasn't really a virus the first time it was deleted!
2. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some dnssd.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
3. [Reinstall the program that uses the dnssd.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the dnssd.dll DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the dnssd.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.  
 For example, [completely uninstall](https://www.lifewire.com/free-uninstaller-programs-2625188) and then reinstall [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) if you see the dnssd.dll error there.  
 One exception that some users have had trouble with is if you see the error after installing Apple's AirPort Utility. That program requires [Bonjour](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en%5FUS) , and might throw the dnssd.dll error (and reference APAgent.exe) if you don't have it installed. So, in this instance, you'd want to install Bonjour and not reinstall AirPort Utility.  
 Alternatively, if you know for sure that you won't be using any other Apple program besides, say, iTunes, you can uninstall all the Apple products you currently have and then reinstall just the one you need. Doing that should clear the error.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the dnssd.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
5. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for hardware devices that might be related to dnssd.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file dnssd.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the drivers for your video card.​  
 The dnssd.dll file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
6. [Roll back a driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) to a previously installed version if dnssd.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause dnssd.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
8. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual dnssd.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
9. Use a[free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair dnssd.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid dnssd.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.
10. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . A clean install of Windows will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the dnssd.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the dnssd.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
11. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any dnssd.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

 The context of the error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem.

 Dnssd.dll is a file used by Apple software such as Bonjour, so error messages most often occur while using or installing Apple software programs, but might also be seen when Windows first starts up.

 Because Apple products use this DLL file, it's stored in the**%programfiles%\\iTunes**  folder.

 The dnssd.dll error message might also apply to other programs or systems that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , [Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.
