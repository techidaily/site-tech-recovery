 While listening to Spotify simultaneously, both host and guests can control the song or the playlist, unless the host changes this setting. It works just like any individual session:

* Host and guests can pause, play, skip, and select tracks to listen together.
* Anyone can also add songs to the queue in the usual way.
* Any change will show up on all grouped devices in real-time.

 If you want to limit guests to adding tracks only, select the**gear** icon at the top of the Jam page > deselect**Let others change what's playing** .
