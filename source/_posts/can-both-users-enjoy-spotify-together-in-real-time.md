##  Can I Listen to Spotify with a Friend at the Same Time? 

 Yes, two people can listen to Spotify simultaneously, thanks to the[ Spotify Jam (formerly Group Session)](https://www.lifewire.com/listen-to-spotify-with-friends-5120356) feature. 

 If you want to add more friends to your listening party, groups of up to 32 people can start listening to a song or a playlist on one device or their own devices via Jam.

 Here's how to start and share a Jam with a friend:  

1. Open Spotify and start playing a song, a playlist, or a podcast.
2. Tap the**Connect** icon from the Now Playing bar.
3. Select the**Start a Jam** .

 While listening to Spotify simultaneously, both host and guests can control the song or the playlist, unless the host changes this setting. It works just like any individual session:

* Host and guests can pause, play, skip, and select tracks to listen together.
* Anyone can also add songs to the queue in the usual way.
* Any change will show up on all grouped devices in real-time.

 If you want to limit guests to adding tracks only, select the**gear** icon at the top of the Jam page > deselect**Let others change what's playing** .
