## Transform Your TV Into A Personalized TikTok Theatre – Easy Methods Inside
### What to Know

* You have two options: Install TikTok on your smart TV or share your device's screen with your TV.
* The TikTok TV app can run directly from some Samsung, LG, and Android TVs. Search the TV's app store for it.
* Mirroring and casting work from phones, tablets, and computers.

 This article explains the different ways you can watch TikTok on your TV. The directions apply to Android, iOS, iPadOS, Windows, macOS, and a variety of smart TVs and streaming devices.

## How to Install TikTok on a TV

 If you have a supported device, you can install TikTok right on your TV. The TikTok TV app works on several TVs:

* Amazon Fire TV
* Android TV
* Chromecast with Google TV
* LG smart TVs (2018 (webOS 4.0) and newer models)
* Samsung smart TVs

 These steps include screenshots from Android TV, but the steps should be essentially the same for other supported sets.

1. Search for**TikTok** from the**Apps** menu on the TV.  
 If you're using Android TV, you can trigger the installation from a computer through the link below, as long as your TV is signed in to the same Google account as your computer. If you do that, continue with Step 3 below.  
 Otherwise, follow the rest of these steps from the TV itself.

 If you're not sure if this will work for your TV, click the link anyway. You can't use this method if you see the message_This app is not available for any of your devices._
2. Select**Install** on that screen and wait while it downloads and installs to your TV.

3. Locate the app if you're not there already, and select**Open** or**Launch** .
4. Choose**Log in** to sign in to your TikTok account, or select**Watch now** to start watching without an account.

## How to Cast TikTok to a TV

 If you don't have a TV that can install the TikTok app, the other option is to use the app normally on your device but then cast the video or mirror the screen to show videos on your TV. There are a few ways to do this but the easiest is to tap the cast button from within the mobile app.

### Cast From a Phone or Tablet

 These steps work for TVs that have a Chromecast. Android must be running Android 6.0 or newer, and an iPhone needs to be updated to iOS 12.0 or newer. Here's how it works from an Android phone:

1. From your phone or tablet, open the TikTok video you want to watch on the TV.
2. Tap the**Share** button.
3. Scroll through the menu and tap**Cast** .

If you use TikTok on your iPad, you can[connect the iPad to the TV](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-connect-the-ipad-to-your-tv-wirelessly-or-with-cables-1994480) .
4. Select your TV or streaming device from the list. TikTok will open on your TV.

### Cast From a Computer

 If you're[using TikTok without the mobile app](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-tiktok-without-app-5272077) , you can still put the videos on the big screen via your desktop web browser.

### Connect to the TV With HDMI

 If those wireless methods have been unhelpful, you can always connect your device to your TV over HDMI. It's a physical connection, so you'll need to sit closer to the TV than you might prefer, but it'll create a more stable connection than wireless and will work for all modern TVs and projectors.

 Follow one of these guides, depending on your device:[connect your iPhone or iPad to your TV](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-from-your-ipad-or-iphone-to-your-tv-4164117) ,[connect your Android device to your TV](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-android-smartphone-tablet-to-tv-4129341) , or[connect your computer to your TV](https://www.lifewire.com/connecting-a-computer-to-tv-817478) .

## Why Isn't TikTok Connecting to My TV?

 Unlike YouTube and other services available on virtually every screen imaginable, TikTok remained only a mobile app in the US[until 2021 when it came to TVs as an app](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-tv) . Europe and North America are the only regions where that app is available. If you can't watch TikTok through the smart TV app, your location is likely the reason.

 You also need to be on the same Wi-Fi network as your TV if you're casting or mirroring your device wirelessly. If your phone, tablet, or computer won't play TikTok on your TV, first check that they're on the same network.

 Mirroring and casting issues can arise if you're not familiar with how it all works. Mirroring requires a compatible TV or streaming stick, so TikTok won't show up on your screen if your device is unable to mirror itself.

 If casting isn't working through the TikTok app or website, there are several things you can do to[fix it when Chromecast isn't working](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-chromecast-when-it-isn-t-working-4628327) .

 FAQ

* How do I watch TikTok on a Roku TV?  
 The Roku app store doesn't currently have a TikTok app. Some third-party options might be available, but if you're concerned about installing something unofficial, you should use a casting option.
* How do I watch TikTok Live on a TV?  
 If your TV has a TikTok app, you can watch streams on TikTok Live directly from there. Otherwise, pull up the feed you want to watch on another device and share its screen with the TV.
