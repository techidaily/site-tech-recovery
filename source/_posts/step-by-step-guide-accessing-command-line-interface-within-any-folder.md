### Change the Folder Path

 Follow these steps for the fastest way to open Command Prompt in a folder. All you have to do is type**cmd** in the right place.

1. [Open File Explorer](https://www.lifewire.com/open-file-explorer-in-windows-11-5192605) to the folder you plan to work in. For example, if it's your Downloads folder, you'd navigate here:  
 `C:\Users\[your username]\Downloads`
2. Erase the folder path at the top of the window. Pressing**Alt** +**d** is a quick way to highlight the whole path.
