## Step 3: Backup Minecraft files

 Although adding mods is usually quite safe, you won’t know what would happen. So here we suggest that you have your Minecraft**.jar** file backed up before installing any mods.  
  
 1) Right-click**minecraft.jar** and select**Copy** .

 You can press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard and type**%appdata%.minecraft\\** to open the file.  
  
![Copy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Copy.jpg)

 2) Create a new folder either on the cloud like Google Drive or One Drive or your computer.  
  
 To do so, you can right-click on the empty space on your desktop and click**New** \>**Folder** . Till then, name the folder.

## BONUS: update your drivers to enjoy the game to the fullest

 Playing games is quite fun. But sometimes you might encounter certain issues like black screen crashes with sound looping or something like that. It definitely destroys your gameplay experience!

 In this case, we recommend you update your audio drivers and graphics drivers in order to better enjoy the playing.

 There are mainly two options you can take to update your drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### **Option 1** : Manually update the drivers

 You can update the drivers by clicking the links based on your needs.  
  
**For graphics drivers:**

### **Option 2** : Automatically update the drivers

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.
