3. Immediately hold down the**Command+R** keys until you see an Apple logo or spinning globe appear.
4. Choose from the Recovery Mode utility options. These include Restore from Time Machine Backup, Reinstall macOS, Get Help Online or Disk Utility.

## How Do I Boot an M1 Mac Into Recovery Mode?

 If you have a newer Mac with an Apple-based processor such as the M1, M2, or M3 chip, the process is slightly different. Here's how to start your Apple Silicon-based Mac in Recovery Mode.

1. Turn off your Mac.
2. Press and hold the**power** button.
3. A message stating you'll be able to access startup options soon will appear. Keep holding the button down.
4. Click**Options > Continue** to open up Recovery.

## Why Won't My Mac Go Into Recovery Mode?

 If your Mac doesn't go into Recovery Mode through conventional means, try these steps to force it.

1. Reboot your Mac.
2. Hold down**Option** /**Alt+Command+R** or**Shift+Option** /**Alt+Command+R** to force your Mac to boot into macOS Recovery Mode over the internet.
3. This combination should boot the Mac into Recovery Mode.

## Does Recovery Mode Delete Everything on a Mac?

 Yes and no. Solely booting into Recovery Mode won't delete everything on your Mac. Still, if you choose to either reinstall macOS or erase a disk via Disk Utility, you will delete everything on your Mac.

 It's a sensible move to reinstall macOS before selling your Mac to someone. Alternatively, use Restore from Time Machine Backup to restore your system to an earlier build. You may lose some files depending on the age of your backup.
