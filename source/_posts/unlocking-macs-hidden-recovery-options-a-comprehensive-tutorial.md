## Why Won't My Mac Go Into Recovery Mode?

 If your Mac doesn't go into Recovery Mode through conventional means, try these steps to force it.

1. Reboot your Mac.
2. Hold down**Option** /**Alt+Command+R** or**Shift+Option** /**Alt+Command+R** to force your Mac to boot into macOS Recovery Mode over the internet.
3. This combination should boot the Mac into Recovery Mode.

## Does Recovery Mode Delete Everything on a Mac?

 Yes and no. Solely booting into Recovery Mode won't delete everything on your Mac. Still, if you choose to either reinstall macOS or erase a disk via Disk Utility, you will delete everything on your Mac.

 It's a sensible move to reinstall macOS before selling your Mac to someone. Alternatively, use Restore from Time Machine Backup to restore your system to an earlier build. You may lose some files depending on the age of your backup.
