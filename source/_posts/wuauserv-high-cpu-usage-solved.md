## Cyberpunk 2077 Display Problems Solved - Achieve Crisp Visual Quality Now

Since its launch, players are enjoying **[Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/cyberpunk-2077?epic%5Fcreator%5Fid=28725b529b5346a38a080b6a920aa97a&epic%5Fgame%5Fid=77f2b98e2cef40c8a7437518bf420e47)**  immensely. But they’ve had some complaints. They notice a sheer amount of blurriness, which definitely affects the gameplay. If you happen to be one of them, don’t worry. Here are some quick fixes for you.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Change in-game settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Enable NVIDIA Image Sharpening](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

![how to fix Cyberpunk 2077 blurry look on PC](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/featured-image-1.jpg)

## Fix 1: Change in-game settings

 Some settings by default may not give you the best performance. With some tweaks, you can reduce blurriness and boost the image quality in Cyberpunk 2077\. Here are the settings you should change:

 1) In your game menu, click**SETTINGS** .  
  
![Cyberpunk 2077 settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/navigate-to-in-game-settings.jpg)

 2) In the**GRAPHICS** tab, set the**Texture Quality** to**Medium** or**High** depending on your system specs.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/TEXTURE-QUALITY.jpg)

Then scroll down and turn off these three options:

**Film Grain** : it makes the picture look fuzzy.  
**Chromatic Aberation** : it blurs the side of the screen and results in it looking weird.  
**Motion Blur** : it can induce lag and even reduce the render quality of some textures.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/graphics-setting.jpg)

 It’s also recommended to turn off**Depth of Field** and**Lens Flare** .

 If you’re using a high-end GPU, you can take advantage of**Ray Tracing** . It makes a big difference in the game.

## Fix 2: Update graphics driver

 Your device drivers, the graphics driver in particular, are important components that greatly impact your computer’s performance. If your game looks blurry, one of the recommended troubleshooting steps you should take is to update your graphics driver especially you can’t remember when was the last time you had it updated.

 Both[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/cyberpunk-2077-game-ready-driver/) and[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-20-12-1) had just released new drivers for Cyberpunk 2077 to make sure gamers get the definitive experience. To get them, please read on.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2: Automatically update your graphics driver (recommended)

 If you are not familiar with computer hardware, and if don’t have the time to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a useful tool that automatically recognizes your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

## Fix 3: Enable NVIDIA Image Sharpening

 If you’ve got an NVIDIA card, there is another way you can boost the image quality even more. That is to enable the image sharpening.

 1) From your desktop, right-click on the empty space and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
  
![oopen NVIDIA Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NVIDIA.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 2) Select**Manage 3D Settings** from the left menu. Then select**Global Settings** . From the list, click on**Image Sharpening** . In the drop-down menu, tick**On** . For the values, leave them at default. After this, simply click**OK** to apply the changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NVIDIA-Image-Sharpening-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872496/14483" target="_top" id="1872496"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872496" border="0" alt="" width="750" height="625"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872496/14483" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Note that this action is to set up image sharpening globally for all games. To enable image sharpening only for your game Cyberpunk 2077, you can select the**Program Settings** tab. Then select your game from the drop-menu and apply the desired settings.  
 (If you are unable to find the program, click on**Add** and choose your game.)

![enable NVIDIA Image Sharpening for a specific game](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/enable-NVIDIA-Image-Sharpening-for-a-specific-game.png)

Once done, there should be a noticeable improvement in the image quality.

1) Quit your game.

2) Press the**Windows logo key** and**E** at the same time to open File Explorer.

3) Head to your drive (where you install your game, it could be C: drive). Then open the folder

4) Open the folder **Program Files (x86) > Steam > steamapps > common > Cyberpunk 2077 > bin > x64** . Then you’ll find**Cyberpunk2077.exe** . Right-click it and select**Properties** .  
  
![disable fullscreen optimizations to fix Cyberpunk 2077 blur](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/click-Properties.jpg)

 5) In the Properties window, select the tab**Compatibility** . Check**Disable fullscreen optimizations** . Then click**Apply > OK** .  
  
![disable fullscreen optimizations to fix Cyberpunk 2077 blur](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/disable-fullscreen-optimizations.jpg)
