## Leading Cable Modem and WiFi Router Packages Reviewed

The best cable modem/router combos will do the same job at a fraction of the cost of two devices, and in a far more straightforward way, with fewer cables and power plugs.

 However, not all modems work with all providers, and you'll need to ensure the unit you buy is compatible with your cable company (such as Spectrum, Cox, or AT&T). Compatibility information can usually be found on your cable provider's website. If not, it's best to call and check before you buy.

[Motorola MG7700 Review](https://www.lifewire.com/motorola-mg7700-review-4589346)

 If it's time to upgrade your modem and your router, the Motorola MG7700 is likely the right one for you if you're a customer of Comcast Xfinity, Cox, or Spectrum and don't pay extra for a superfast plan. Your cable company (or even your monthly bill) will be able to tell you what speed connection you have. Still, as a rough guide, if you're on a basic plan, it almost certainly won't be what's known as a 1-gigabit connection, and if it is, we've got picks for you below.

 One of the best features of the Motorola MG7700 we like most has nothing to do with its technical prowess: It's not terribly ugly. To get the best range from its wireless signal, you don't want to hide the modem/router behind furniture or in a closet. But this unit is just inoffensive enough that you can put it on a side table in the living room and not be embarrassed.

 Crucially for when things go wrong, the light indicators are also easy to see and understandâ€”something you don't typically find in a modem from a cable company.

 The MG7700 has four ethernet ports for you to hook up some equipment via a physical cable for better speed and reliability, which is often a good idea for devices like a games console, Smart TV, or[Apple TV](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-apple-tv-1994193) . It can easily stream your movies and TV in[4K, also called Ultra HD](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) . It's the standard for really, really sharp pictures. It's also more than capable of doing a great job with Zoom or FaceTime calls.

 One more caveat is that if your internet connection includes a voice package (confusingly called VOIP, you'll know if you have it as you will have a phone number as part of your internet package), you'll need to look at this model's older brother: the[Motorola MT7711](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GX2ZQXG/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4082541%7Cnb2837cc0a07640b28e632f95df0f8e6713%7C) .

[Netgear Nighthawk C7000 Review](https://www.lifewire.com/netgear-nighthawk-c7000-review-4686068)

 If you consider yourself a power user and you're an Xfinity, Spectrum, or Cox user, the Netgear Nighthawk C7000 might check all the boxes. Let's see. Capable of a pretty fast connection? Check! Four ports for lots of additional devices? Check! A good range for big homes (2,500 square feet): Check! Not ugly: Check (mostly)!

 These capabilities are reflected in the higher price tag, and it could be overkill for the average user's internet needs. It really comes down to whether you're a gamer or stream to different TVs in the house at the same time. Another bonus is that if you're an Xfinity phone service customer, you can plug your landline handset right in.

 If you have a home big enough where a room isn't used all that often (or rooms, for that matter), and you have a super-high-speed gigabit connection (your cable company can tell you this), this could be the combo modem router for you.

## Or Maybe These?

* **I want to splurge.** The[Netgear Nighthawk Cable Modem and WiFi 6 Router Combo (CAX80)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082XW53G3/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4082541%7Cnb2837cc0a07640b28e632f95df0f8e6713%7C) has all the wireless bells and whistles you could ask for, and it's excellent for gaming.
* **What about mesh networks?** The[Netgear Orbi Whole Home WiFi 6 System](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GWFH4J6/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4082541%7Cnb2837cc0a07640b28e632f95df0f8e6713%7C) comprises two units to ensure your home is covered with a strong Wi-Fi signal. You can add more to get virtually unlimited coverage if you have a large home.
* **I have Gigabit internet.** The[ARRIS SURFboard SBG8300](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07M9J3XW2/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4082541%7Cnb2837cc0a07640b28e632f95df0f8e6713%7C) is a fast modem/router that supports high-speed internet.

## What to Look for in a Modem/Router Combo

### Bandwidth

 To take full advantage of the bandwidth your ISP provides, you'll need a modem/router combo that, at the very least, matches, and ideally exceeds, the top speed promised by your provider. The maximum bandwidth is indicated in gigabits per second (Gbps) and is usually prominently displayed in a modem/router's title or description.

### Bands

 Routers are increasingly offering multiple data bands (think of traffic lanes) to reduce bottlenecking and increase efficiency in directing network traffic. Dual-band devices typically supply 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, with the 5 GHz band providing more peak bandwidth. Tri-band routers provide an additional 5 GHz band to sort devices into, reducing congestion when multiple devices are attached to a network simultaneously.

### Range

 Nearly any modem/router combo will provide ample coverage for your entire living space if you live in an apartment or modest home. However, pay close attention to the range indicated by the model you're considering for larger homes. You may also want to consider a modem/router with beamforming technology, which shapes the signal from the router into a tighter beam to direct it toward specific devices, delivering a more robust and faster signal. Alternatively, you may be better off with a separate[cable modem](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-cable-modem-5181545) and a[mesh network](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-mesh-network-4842178) .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Ethernet Ports

 Ensure your router has enough Ethernet ports for the devices you want to plug in. If you have an internet plan that offers speeds above 100 Mbps, you'll want to get one with [Gigabit Ethernet](https://www.lifewire.com/definition-of-gigabit-ethernet-816338) ports to take maximum advantage of your plan.  

### Wi-Fi Standards

 Unless you have a basic internet plan, you'll want support for relatively modern Wi-Fi standards. On the Wi-Fi side, a cable modem/router combo works the same as any other wireless router, meaning you'll choose from the same Wi-Fi standards and frequencies, such as [802.11n](https://www.lifewire.com/802-11n-wireless-network-818281) and [802.11ac](https://www.lifewire.com/802-11ac-in-wireless-networking-818284) , which have recently been redesignated as _Wi-Fi 4_ and _Wi-Fi 5_ , respectively to make life easier. You may also have heard of the newer [Wi-Fi 6 802.11ax](https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345) standard, which is starting to appear.

 It's not a bad idea to invest in technology for the future, but it will be a while before you're likely to really need Wi-Fi 6 in your home or even be able to take advantage of it entirely.  

 FAQ

* What is a cable modem/router combo?  
 A cable modem/router combo is a single device that combines the capabilities of a cable modem with the features of a Wi-Fi router. You plug it directly into your coaxial cable just like you would a cable modem, and then connect your computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices directly using either wired Gigabit Ethernet connections or Wi-Fi.
* Is it better to get a modem/router combo or separate devices?  
 Buying a cable modem/router combo can save you quite a bit of money since these all-in-one units are usually far more affordable than buying a cable modem and a router separately. If you're renting your cable modem, you can save even more by returning that to your ISP, reducing your monthly bill. That said, while modern cable modem/routers are very capable if you have more advanced needs, there are many more options and advanced features to be found among the best wireless routers.
* Does my cable modem/router need to be approved by my ISP?  
 In most cases, yes. Since your cable modem has to be registered with your ISP to work properly, it's important to buy one that's guaranteed to be compatible. While some ISPs may let you register any cable modem, most will refuse to set one up that isn't on its approved list. Fortunately, most major cable providers in the U.S. have already "pre-approved" the cable modems from all the big manufacturers. You'll normally find this information on the packaging or on the manufacturer's website. However, if you're still not sure, you can always ask your cable provider if the modem/router you're considering will work with their network.
* What does 'Approved for plans up to' mean?  
 When a cable provider tests a modem and certifies it as compatible with their network, they also specify the maximum speed that they're willing to guarantee on their network. This number is usually lower than the maximum possible speed of a cable modem, and it's not always the same for each ISP. Think of it like the difference between how fast your car can actually go and the varying speed limits on your local highways. You might get better performance than the ISP's maximum rating, but don't count on it.
