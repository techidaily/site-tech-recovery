## Join the Battle - A Comprehensive Guide on How to Excel in Pokémon Unite

Close 

###  What to Know

* Battle wild Pokémon to level up and unlock new attacks.
* Attack opponent Pokémon to steal their Aeos energy.
* Deposit collected Aeos energy in opponents' goals to score points.

 This beginner’s guide to_Pokémon Unite_ covers everything you need to know about this multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, how it differs from other_Pokémon_ titles, and what you’re actually supposed to be doing in each match. Information in this article applies to both Nintendo Switch and mobile versions.  

##  'Pokémon' Unite Gameplay Basics 

 While inspired by the main_Pokémon_ video game series,_Pokémon Unite_ features an entirely different play style and even ignores some basic lore, which can make the experience rather intimidating and confusing for both new and long-time fans.

 The 30 minutes or so of tutorials that you must play through when you first start_Pokémon Unite_ do explain a lot of the main gameplay concepts. However, they also throw so much information at you that it’s totally understandable if you’ve forgotten most of what they cover.

 Here’s what you need to know to play_Pokémon Unite_ .  

1. Collect Aeos energy by defeating Pokémon. Every time you win a battle, your opponent will release Aeos energy orbs, which you can collect by touching them.

2. Deposit your collected Aeos energy at your opponent’s goals. You could collect 100 Aeos energy orbs, but none of them will count towards your team’s score until you place them in one of several goals on the opposite side of the map.  
 If you have Aeos orbs to deposit, the orange and purple Pokéball icon next to your attack icons will light up while you’re standing on a goal. Select that icon to charge it and deposit all of your orbs.  
![A goal on Pokemon United with orange and purple ball icon highlighted.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_OMg7EZhpdf5F2qEhg-sme0YMxA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-07-fbe4b1ebf0c24dc8b48da91cbee757ba.jpg)
3. Attack wild Pokémon to level up. They release some Aeos energy, but you really want to defeat them to earn XP to level up.  
 Leveling up your Pokémon not only makes it stronger, but it can unlock more powerful attacks and even evolve it depending on its species.  
 All Eevee evolutions start matches as Eevee. Earn enough XP by fighting wild Pokémon to have them automatically evolve into the form you selected before the match.  
![Eevee and a wild Pokemon in Pokemon United.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/m-skRaiIpVM-TxSFBVAKyTKNXjQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-06-015eb74ab53b4f16b35dd8ba63640c77.jpg)
4. Attack opponent Pokémon to steal their Aeos energy. You can tell an opponent Pokémon from a wild one by the team color icon in their health bar that displays the number of Aeos orbs they have. Defeat them Pokémon to take their Aeos energy, and then run to a goal to deposit it.

5. Ignore elemental type strengths and weaknesses from previous_Pokémon_ games. A Fire-type Pokémon may have been strong against a Grass-type in other games, but in_Pokémon Unite_ , it’s all about level, class type, and little else. Therefore, a strong Fire Pokémon can take down your Water Pokémon with just a few hits, so be careful.  
 Ignore traditional element types and choose your Pokémon based on the attack and defense styles that suit your play style.

6. Running low on health? Run back to one of the goals on your side of the board to heal.  
 Your opponents can also heal on their goals as well, so it’s best not to attack them if they’re standing on one because they'll heal as soon as you damage them. They aren't invincible, but they’ll definitely be at an advantage.

7. Certain wild Pokémon grant abilities and can win the match. It can be tempting to target your opponents once you’re strong enough but don’t ignore wild Pokémon, especially the larger ones, which can give you boosts, shields, and buffs.  
 If you’ve gained a benefit after defeating a wild Pokémon, your Pokémon will have a colored aura.

8. Defeating Zapdos could win the match. During the final two minutes of the match, the legendary electric bird, Zapdos, will appear at the center of the map. Whoever performs the final hit on Zapdos before its defeat earns 30 Aeos, while everyone on their team receives 20 Aeos each.  
 These points could win your team the match even if you were falling way behind. It’s kind of like catching the Golden Snitch in Quidditch in the[ Harry Potter movies](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-harry-potter-movies-in-order-5084792) .  
 You still need to deposit the earned Aeos at a goal for them to count. Fortunately, this means that if your opponents defeat Zapdos, you have an opportunity to steal their Aeos before they turn them in.  
![Wigglytuff and Zapdos in Pokemon Unite.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vVO6pf-Ao83RsiMhuX2HZlexfus=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/how-to-play-pokemon-united-10-959df5b560804bb4a351b1389a95da62.jpg)
9. Check the Battle Prep menu in the lobby before the match starts. This screen will show you which path on the map is recommended for your Pokémon and will also let you customize your default attacks.  
 You can explore any part of the map during the match, but selecting a section will let the rest of your team know what area you’re planning to cover.

##  How to Get Coins in 'Pokémon Unite' 

 Aeos coins are one of the in-game currencies in_Pokémon Unite_ . They look like gold coins, and you can redeem them for cosmetics and Pokémon Unite Licenses in the in-game shop.

 The easiest ways to earn coins in_Pokémon Unite_ are to finish the tutorials, complete daily missions, and play matches to earn trainer points.

 You can only earn 2,100 coins per week. If you’ve stopped getting coins as rewards, this is likely why. The coin limit resets every Monday at midnight UTC.

##  How to Change Names in 'Pokémon Unite' 

 To change your trainer name in_Pokémon Unite_ , you need to purchase an item called the**Rename Card** from the**Aeos Emporium** section of the in-game store. The**Rename Card** costs 100 gems (about $2).

##  How to Block a Goal in 'Pokémon Unite' 

 The best way to block a goal is to attack your opponent while they’re depositing all of their Aeos energy. A powerful attack can knock them off of the goal, but usually, just the attack itself will motivate your opponent to move out of the way to safety.

 Another way to stop a player from depositing Aeos is to use a springboard to jump on top of them. Springboards look like gray metallic squares. Stand on one to activate it.  

##  How to Change Your Character's Gender in 'Pokémon Unite' 

 Unfortunately, it’s impossible to change your character’s gender in_Pokémon Unite_ , so make sure you select the option you want when you create your profile.

 One alternative is to change their clothes to make them look more like a different gender (or even gender ambiguous). Many players do this and end up creating some great looks.
