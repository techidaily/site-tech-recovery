## Comprehensive Tips to Correct the Lost or Absent mfpLat.dll File
 Mfplat.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the mfplat[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . This file is part of Microsoft's[Media Foundation Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/microsoft-media-foundation-sdk?redirectedfrom=MSDN) . Not all versions of Windows have this installed, which is one reason the file might be missing.

 This error could apply to any program or system that might use the file on any of Microsoft's operating systems, including Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8, etc.

## How to Fix Mfplat.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Don't download mfplat.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore mfplat.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" mfplat.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you might be able to[recover the file with a free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . However, this is a smart idea only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Install the Media Feature pack from Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack) to restore the missing mfplat.dll file. Windows N versions don't include the media pack by default and therefore require a manual installation of it.  
 There are two download links to pick from. See[How to Tell if You Have Windows 64-Bit or 32-Bit](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475) if you're not sure which one you need to select.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Installing the program that provides the mfplat.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
3. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some mfplat.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect the mfplat.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
5. [Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161) to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the mfplat.dll file. If this file is provided by Microsoft in your version of Windows, the[System File Checker](https://www.lifewire.com/sfc-command-system-file-checker-2626020) tool should restore it.
6. [Reinstall the program that uses the mfplat.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.
7. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to mfplat.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file mfplat.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 This file may or may not be related to video cards—this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
8. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if the errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
9. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft-distributed DLL files on your computer. The mfplat.dll file could be included in one of those updates.
10. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . I've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause mfplat.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) .
11. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual mfplat.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
12. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair mfplat.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid mfplat.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 I rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners, but they're included as an option here as a last-resort attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
13. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This erases everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and installs a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the mfplat.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make the best attempt you can to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
14. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any mfplat.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

## Causes of Mfplat.dll Errors

 In some cases, mfplat.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware problem, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

![Screenshot of an mfplat.dll error message](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/5MNKpVw1u_5udN3edS5wbRYSReg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mfplat-dll-error-message-59b2e7669abed50011a7b9de.png)

 There are several ways these DLL errors can show up on your computer. Here are some of the more common messages:

* **Mfplat.dll Not Found**
* **This application failed to start because mfplat.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.**
* **Cannot find \[PATH\]\\mfplat.dll**
* **The program can't start because mfplat.dll is missing from your computer**
* **The file mfplat.dll is missing.**
* **Cannot start \[APPLICATION\]. A required component is missing: mfplat.dll. Please install \[APPLICATION\] again.**

 These errors might appear while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation. The context of the error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem.
