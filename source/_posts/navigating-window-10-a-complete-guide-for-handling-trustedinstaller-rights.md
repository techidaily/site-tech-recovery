## Why Do I Need Permission From TrustedInstaller?

 Provided you're the primary user of your home computer, you might be surprised to find out you need anyone’s permission to deal with files on your own PC.

 All Windows 10 PCs have an in-built Microsoft account known as the TrustedInstaller. This account exists to prevent accidental damage to important system files, so it's given ownership over many important operating system files. For you to be able to take control of these files, you need to make yourself the owner as described above.
