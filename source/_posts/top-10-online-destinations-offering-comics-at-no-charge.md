Thank you for asking. Since Kindle cloud reader books cannot be downloaded now, we are seeking for other ways to handle kindle books. But it will need some time.   
 You can just try Epubor Ultimate to remove kindle drm (downloaded via kindle for pc/mac older version).

GetComics.com Use'd to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.  
 but is unusable now with those ads cominng in fast from all sides'  
 You cant out run them. I had downloaded so many things from that site.  
 I want to know if you make a donation if all those adds will go away?
