 After you upgrade your system to Window 10, your Logitech mouse doesn’t work properly or doesn’t work at all, the problem most probably caused due to driver issues. The mouse driver might be removing, outdated, incompatible with the new system, or driver conflicts occur. Most often, you can resolve the problem by updating the drivers.

 You can go to[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to check if there is problem with Logitech Mouse driver. If there is a yellow mark next to the mouse device, the driver is not working properly.

 Before updating drivers, try the following tricks first. They may work like a charm on your case.

**1\. Unplug the mouse and plug the mouse again.**
**2 . Test the mouse on a different USB port.**

 Following methods are for your reference how to update Logitech Mouse drivers.

## **1\. Use Windows Update**

 You can use [Windows Update](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to check for the updates in Windows 10\. It may detect the right mouse driver automatically. If this feature in your Window 10 has been set to install updates automatically, you can disregard this way.

## **2\. Update the Driver Manually**

 You can go to Logitech website then download the Logitech drivers here:[http://support.logitech.com/en_us/downloads](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Please make sure you download the right driver, as wrong driver may cause problems. After you download the driver, usually, you can just double click on the downloaded file then follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
