1 KUAL: Kindle Unified Application Launcher 

This is a launcher app, in which anybody can plug into to provide new buttons and menus through extensions. With those buttons and menus, you can use KAUL as a configuration UI for your stuff. KUAL listed as a required dependency because a number of hacks ship with a KUAL extension. As long as your FW >= 2.3, the KUAL can run on it.

**Kindle 7, KPW 1/2/3, KV installation:**   
Firstly, download the [KUAL-v2.7.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/xhknag24bxcxped/KUAL-v2.7.zip/file) and unpack it.   
Secondly, copy the azw2 file to the document folder of your Kindle. If your device runs on FW 5.x, use the KUAL-KDK-2.0.azw2 file. If your device is older, use the KUAL-KDK-1.0.azw2 file.   
Thirdly, eject the Kindle device and open the Kindle, you will see a title “ Kindle Launcher”.

**Kindle 8, KO installation:**  
 Firstly, you have to install [MobileRead Package Installer (MRPI)](http://www.epubor.com/#mrpi1).It is a technically a KUAL extension and that we are in effect doing things in reverse.   
Secondly, find the Update\_KUALBooklet\_v\*\_install.bin at the unpacked [KUAL-v2.7.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/xhknag24bxcxped/KUAL-v2.7.zip/file) file and copy it the mrpackages folder, which you'll find at the root of your Kindle.   
Thirdly, eject your Kindle and open it. Enter _;log mrpi_ in the Homescreen's searchbar , and wait for MRPI to install KUAL. When the UI finishes restarting, you should end up with a KUAL entry in your Library.

2 KUAL Extension 

**Helper** 

The helper extension is a small tool set.

Installation:   
Firstly, unpack[the kual-helper-0.5.N.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/du2i5xpeuy5eylg/kual-helper-0.5.N.zip/file)and copy it to the root of your device. You will find an extensions folder with a helper subdirectory in it. Each extension lives as its own subdirectory inside the extensions folder. Extensions should always be packaged this way, but if they're not, unpack them inside the extensions directory instead.   
 Secondly, enter KUAL and click on helper+, you will enter into small tool set. Click “PREVENT ScreenSaver” to forbid Kindle to falling asleep while click “ALLOW ScreenSaver” can recover the sleeping setting. 

**MobileRead Package Installer (MRPI)**

This is a KUAL extension which designed to break through the restrictions imposed on OTA packages by FW5.5.x. Because the Kindle firmware does not allow install the plug with .bin files directly, MRPI can help the installation process. 

Installation:   
Firstly, unpack [kual-mrinstaller](http://www.mediafire.com/file/avll9f7pgkxf3hx/kual-mrinstaller-1.6.N.zip/file
) file.  
Secondly, copy extensions and mrpackages to the root directory of your Kindle via USB. If there is already a extensions folder on your Kindle, you just have to copy the content of it to the original extension folder.  
Thirdly, eject Kindle from computer, you will find MRPI in KUAL’s Helper menu.

**Battery Status**

As a Kual extension, it will display the battery status of your Kindle as percentage more than a battery bar. With it, you can know exactly how much battery is left.

To know the installation, please just go to read the article on our site: [3 Ways to Check Kindle Battery Percentage](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

3 Kpvbooklet

KPVBooklet is a Kindle booklet for starting KoReader and updating last access and percentage finished information in Kindle content catalog entry of the opened document. KPVBooklet is licensed under the MIT license.

4 Reader Apps

**Koreader**

3, Eject the Kindle and go to \[HOME\] -> \[MENU\] > Settings -> \[MENU\] > Update Your Kindle.  
This time, the update will succeed, and will install my developer keys into _/var/local/java/keystore/developer.keystore_. In case you already are an official KDK developer, any existing developer.keystore file will be backed up into that directory. 

Then install the Mangle to your Kindle  
 1, Download [mangle-0.2.zip](http://code.google.com/p/adqmisc/downloads/detail?name=mangle-0.2.zip) from here and unpack it.

 3, Copy the extracted directory structure onto the root of the kindle USB drive. (e.g. "mangle.azw2 should end up in your kindle documents folder).   
 4, Disconnect, and wait for the home screen to refresh.  
 5, When all has been done, "mangle" should appear as an option.

When I try to open KUAL, I get an error saying "Error - this device is not authorised as a test Kindle by the developer of this item. Please contact the developer."

 What have I done wrong?

I own Kindle Paperwhite 10th gen. It came with firmware 5.12.1 which did not open or recognized KUAL, even though I thought I had it jailbroken. I downgraded the firmware to 5.10.1.3, Jailbroke again successfully and installed KUAL. Then upgraded FW to 5.11.2, which was the highest ver. known for not causing any trouble but older than my original 5.12.1\. With KUAL I can run all I want. I specifically wanted KOreader for opening epub books. I blocked auto updates of FW, and run it in airplane mode which also has the benefit of saving the power. Downgrading firmware is always risky with possibility bricking the kindle. If interested, look up thread 335590 at \[mobileread com\] forum.
