 If you have difficulty rolling out of bed, Alarmy can help you rise and shine. What makes this one different (and annoying, in a good way) is that you’re required to perform other tasks before you can shut the alarm off. For example, you can turn off the alarm by shaking it 50 times, completing a math problem, or snapping a photo of your coffee mug. While it’s not an alarm for everyone, it can be helpful for folks who hit the snooze button longer than they should.

It works with[ Samsung Health](https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-health-how-it-works-4172072) and Google Fit, and is compatible with[ Spotify](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-spotify-4685829) for radio and music alarms.
