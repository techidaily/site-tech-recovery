## How to Fix D3dx9\_33.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the more likely fixes first.

 Do not, under any circumstances, download d3dx9\_33.dll individually from any DLL download site. There are a number of reasons why[downloading DLLs from these sites is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you've already done so, remove it from wherever you put it and continue with the following steps.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't yet done so.  
 The d3dx9\_33.dll error might be a fluke or one-time issue, and a simple restart could clear it up completely. It's unlikely this will fix the problem, but restarting is always a good first troubleshooting step.
2. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Chances are, upgrading to the latest version of DirectX will fix the DLL not found error.  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without updating the version number or letter, so be sure to install the latest_release_ even if your version is technically the same.
3. Assuming the latest DirectX version from Microsoft doesn't fix the d3dx9\_33.dll error you're receiving, look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD. Usually, if a game or ​another program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will include a copy of DirectX on the installation disc.  
 Sometimes, though not often, the version included on the disc is a better fit for the program than the latest version available online.
4. [Uninstall the game or software program and then reinstall it again](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . Something may have happened to the files in the program that work with this DLL, and a reinstall could do the trick.
5. [Restore the d3dx9_33.dll file from the latest DirectX package](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . If the above troubleshooting steps haven't worked to solve your d3dx9\_33.dll error message, try extracting the file individually from the DirectX package.
6. [Update the drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) for your video card. While it's not the most common solution, in some situations updating the drivers for the video card in your computer could correct this DirectX issue.

## Causes D3dx9\_33.dll Errors

![d3dx9_33.dll error message](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/WbpE-u3thFuLrWXrf9cp5CtCcgo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/d3dx9_33-error-message-ef487c20d7694b3790d39287d135b5d0.png)

 Unlike many other[DLL](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) errors which can have complicated causes and fixes, d3dx9\_33.dll issues are caused in one way or another by a single problem—some kind of issue with Microsoft DirectX.

 The d3dx9\_33.dll file is one of many files contained in the DirectX software collection. Since DirectX is utilized by most Windows-based games and advanced graphics programs, d3dx9\_33.dll errors usually show up only when using these programs.

 D3dx9\_33.dll errors may show up on your computer in any of a number of different forms, such as any of these error messages:

* **D3DX9\_33.DLL Not Found**
* **File d3dx9\_33.dll not found**
* **The dynamic link library d3dx9\_33.dll could not be found in the specified path \[PATH\]**
* **D3dx9\_33.dll not found. Reinstalling might help fix this**
* **The file d3dx9\_33.dll is missing**
* **D3DX9\_33.DLL is missing. Replace D3DX9\_33.DLL and try again**
* **Missing component d3dx9\_33.dll**
* **This application has failed to start because d3dx9\_33.dll could not be found**

 These errors typically appear when a software program, usually a game, is started. Occasionally, d3dx9\_33.dll errors will display after a game is loaded but right before gameplay begins.

 Again, this error could apply to any program that utilizes DirectX, such as OpenIV, but it's most commonly video games. Some examples of common games that have been known to generate these errors include_Lost Planet: Extreme Condition_ ,_Colin McRae DiRT_ ,_Scarlet Weather Rhapsody_ ,_BioShock_ ,_Red Light Center_ ,_World in Conflict_ ,_Civilization IV_ ,_SimCity Societies_ ,_Chessmaster: Grandmaster Edition_ ,_Patchcon: Defend the Library_ , and_Spider-Man: Friend or Foe_ .
