* **Temperature reader** : A new wrist temperature feature works overnight to determine your body temperature. The iPhone Health app shows temperature differences from the baseline (not your actual temperature).
* **Cycle tracking** : Cycle Tracking tells you if you have prolonged periods or abnormal cycles.
* **Crash detection** :[ The Apple Watch already has fall detection](https://www.lifewire.com/turn-apple-watch-into-a-panic-button-for-seniors-156676) that can tell when you've had a bad fall. The Apple Watch Series 8 includes an upgrade that will do the same for car crashes; it will dial emergency services if necessary and contact your emergency contacts.
* **Low Power Mode** : Save battery life by having some features turn off when the battery is low, like the always-on display and automatic workout detection.[ Low Power Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/use-low-power-mode-on-apple-watch-6828394) doubles the battery life from 18 hours to 36 hours and works on all Apple Watches running watchOS 9 (Series 4 and newer).
* **International roaming** : This feature is now available on cellular models, starting with the Series 5.
* **watchOS 9** : The[ new watchOS](https://www.lifewire.com/new-watchos-will-offer-more-insight-about-you-5324631) will bring four new watch faces, an updated Siri UI and banner notifications, additional metrics in the Workout app, Sleep Stages for the Sleep app, AFib History, health data sharing, the Medications app to track medications and learn about drug interactions, new keyboard languages, and more.

##  Apple Watch Series 8 Specs and Hardware 

 The Apple Watch Series 8 keeps the Series 7's 41 and 45mm screen sizes, but 2022's other models offer more variety. The pared-down Apple Watch SE has 40 and 44mm options, while the Ultra bumps the screen up to 49mm.

 The Series 8 boasts an edge-to-edge, always-on Retina display to make the most of its case; Apple says it has 20% more screen area than the smaller SE.

 The Series 8 includes various new hardware and features. It still monitors your heart rate, including on-demand ECG and blood oxygen readings using an updated, third-generation sensor. Temperature monitoring is the main health update, but it will also include accelerometer features like fall and[ crash detection](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-crash-detection-6748193) . The GPS will also work with the updated Compass app to let you set waypoints and backtrack if you lose your way.

 Apple Watch Series 8 keeps the 32GB storage capacity that has been the standard since the Series 5\. It also uses the W3 wireless chip that originated with the Series 4\. Its ultra-wideband U1 chip is the same as the one that's been in the past few models, but Apple has upgraded the "system on a chip" to the S8, which also appears in the SE 2 and Ultra models.

 The Apple Watch 8 is available with various aluminum and stainless steel cases, each with several color options. Aluminum cases come in Moonlight (black), Starlight (white), silver, and red; the stainless steel colors are graphite, silver, and gold.

 Apple also introduced some new bands for the Ultra model, but some of them also work with certain sizes of the Series 8\. The 45mm version can use the Alpine Loop, Trail Loop, and Ocean Loop bands (below). The smaller case only works with the older bands.
