 Msvcr80.dll errors occur when the msvcr80 [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) is removed or corrupted. In some cases, msvcr80.dll errors could be due to problems with the [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) , a[virus](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-computer-virus-4799053) , or a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

 This article is about fixing msvcr80.dll errors, not to be confused with[msvcr90.dll errors](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-msvcr90-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623807) .

2. [Restore msvcr80.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) if you accidentally deleted it.

3. [Run a virus/malware scan](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) if you think the msvcr80.dll error could be caused by a hostile program masquerading as the DLL file.
4. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the msvcr80.dll error was caused by recent changes made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) might be able to restore it.

5. [Reinstall the program that uses the msvcr80.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) if you encounter these errors when using a particular program. Doing so should replace the missing DLL file.  
![Uninstall apps in the Windows settings](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aR4ZlFW-s9gwHqMKvW-W07CQYKU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_how-to-fix-msvcr80-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623805-1c4381251a3f4f778657b0bc91aef6cb.jpg)
6. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Some[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and [patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) installed through Windows Update include important updates that could be related to this DLL file.
7. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . This should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions, which might include the msvcr80.dll file.
8. Use a [registry cleaner program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair msvcr80.dll related issues in the registry. This will remove invalid msvcr80.dll [registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.  
 Only really specific "fix it" solutions call for a registry cleaner. You can read more on what they do and when you might need one in our[Registry Cleaners FAQ](https://www.lifewire.com/registry-cleaner-faq-2625124) .
9. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . As a last resort, this step will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of the operating system.

 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean installation.
10. Use a [free memory testing tool](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) or a [hard drive testing program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) to check for [hardware-related DLL errors](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) . If the hardware fails any of your tests, [replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or [replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible, or take your PC to a professional [computer repair service](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-get-my-computer-fixed-2625167) .
