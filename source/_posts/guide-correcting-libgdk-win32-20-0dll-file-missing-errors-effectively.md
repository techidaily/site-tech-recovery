## libgdk-win32-2.e-0.dll File Not Found? Here's How to Fix It
 Libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the libgdk-win32-2.0-0 [DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) . In some cases, these errors could indicate a [registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a [hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

 This DLL error could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) . This includes[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , [Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Do not download libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore the file from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Reinstall the program that uses the libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.​  
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) ,[Audacious](https://audacious-media-player.org/) ,[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) , and[UFRaw](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ufraw/) are just a few software applications known to use this DLL file. Installing one of those might be enough to copy the file to your computer.  
 If the error persists after a reinstallation,[copy the DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-windows-2619210) from wherever the program put it, and paste it in the folder the error says it's missing from.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this error.
3. If you're seeing this error when trying to use a plug-in you've downloaded for GIMP, make sure you run the plug-in from inside the GIMP program instead of via the plug-ins folder.  
 This very specific problem arises when you've installed the[G'MIC](http://gmic.eu/) plug-in (and possibly others) for GIMP, but then try to open it as a standalone program via the program's plug-ins folder. Instead of doing that, open GIMP and then find the plug-in in the **Filters** menu.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file.
5. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
6. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the error.  
 We rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners, but it's included here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.
8. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
9. Troubleshoot for a hardware problem if any libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.
