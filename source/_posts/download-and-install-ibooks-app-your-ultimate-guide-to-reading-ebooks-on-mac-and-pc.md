Won't Crack Latest iBook DRM

[Re:iBooks for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

I tried to remove the DRM from an ebook I just purchase (6-17-14). EPubDRMRemoval, Requiem and ePubeeDRMRemoval apps all failed. Some replied with success... did not happen. EPubDRMRemoval at least gave an error stating that it could not remove this type of DRM.  
 I hope someone cracks it soon so I can use it in a reader of my choice.
