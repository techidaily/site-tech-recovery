## Chronological Viewing Plan for All Major X-Men Films – Watch Like a Pro
### What to Know

* To watch the_X-Men_ movies in order of release, start with_X-Men_ (2000) and end with_The New Mutants_ (2020).
* Chronological order: We recommend starting with_X-Men: First Class_ (set in 1962) and ending with_Logan_ (2029).
* You can watch all the X-Men movies on Disney+.

 This article explains how to watch the_X-Men_ movies in order of release or in chronological order.  

## How to Watch X-Men Movies in Order of Release

 The_X-Men_ films from 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios under Disney) were trailblazers for superhero films. However, with so many changing hands and visions in the course of two decades, the viewing order for the series and the larger X-Men timeline as a whole is a bit muddy.

 By far the most coherent way to watch the X-Men films is in the order of their theatrical and home releases. From there, you can witness how the franchise evolved and changed in style.

| **Movie**                    | **Release Date** | **Where to Watch** |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| _X-Men_                      | July 2000        | Disney+            |

| _Deadpool 2_                 | May 2018         | Disney+            |
| _Dark Phoenix_               | June 2019        | Disney+            |

## How to Stream the X-Men Movies

Otherwise, you can rent all of these movies on digital storefronts such as iTunes, Amazon Prime Video, or[Fandango at Home](https://www.lifewire.com/vudu-adds-tv-shows-on-demand-1847424) .  

 This guide only covers the_X-Men_ and mutant films produced by 20th Century Fox. The franchise is unconnected to the[Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is also available to stream](https://www.lifewire.com/watch-marvel-movies-in-order-online-5077381) , and consists of the original_X-Men_ trilogy, a prequel_X-Men Beginnings_ series, an informal trilogy of_Wolverine_ films, two_Deadpool_ films, and a horror spin-off called_The New Mutant_ s. X-Men TV shows such as_The Gifted_ and_Legion_ are not included.
