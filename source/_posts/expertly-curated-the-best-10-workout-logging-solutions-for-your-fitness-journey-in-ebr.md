## Expert Fixes for When Your Samsung Soundbar Goes Quiet: Comprehensive Solutions
 If you're experiencing issues with your Samsung soundbar, there could be several reasons, and the problems could manifest themselves in any of these scenarios:

* The soundbar won't connect to your TV.
* The soundbar won't connect to other audio equipment, like a subwoofer.
* The soundbar appears to be connected, but no sound is coming out.

 Regardless of how the issue manifests, there are a few troubleshooting steps to try that may get your system working again. This article covers those troubleshooting steps.

## Why Is My Samsung Soundbar Not Working?

 The factors that cause your Samsung soundbar to stop working could include faulty connections, settings issues, or hardware malfunctions. This guide walks you through troubleshooting steps to try, from the most likely solution to the least.

## How to Fix It When Your Samsung Soundbar Isn't Working

 The troubleshooting steps below should help get your Samsung soundbar working again. Try each step in order, working through them until you find the solution to your problem.

1. Disconnect and then[reconnect your soundbar](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-tv-to-external-audio-system-1846816) . Cables that aren't seated well or in the wrong connections could prevent your soundbar from working correctly. Disconnect all the cables and then reconnect them to see if this might fix your issue.  
 Also, be sure to disconnect your power cable. Don't plug it back in until all the other connections are reseated securely to allow the soundbar to read the connections correctly.
2. Make sure the soundbar is set to the correct source. It seems like a simple solution, but if your soundbar is set to a different source than you're using, you might not hear any sound from it at all.
3. Make sure the source is on. It's another simple solution that can sometimes be a sure fix. If the source for your audio isn't powered on, it won't transmit any audio data to the soundbar, so it can seem as if your soundbar isn't working.
4. Ensure your TV is[set up to use external speakers](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-and-set-up-a-sound-bar-4138615) and that the soundbar is your default speaker. Depending on the model of television you have, it might not automatically detect your soundbar. In your television's settings, make sure you've chosen the correct settings to use your soundbar as your primary source of audio.
5. Disconnect and then reconnect the Bluetooth connection. Depending on the device you're connecting to, the steps for removing and reconnecting to Bluetooth might differ. However, if there is a bad Bluetooth connection, walking through those steps could get the soundbar working again.
6. Soft reset your soundbar. Turn off your TV, disconnect all the cables, and wait two minutes. Then reconnect everything and turn your TV back on to see if everything might work again. It will sometimes work if there is static or other electrical interference in the line.
7. Hard reset the soundbar. Sometimes a reset is all you need to get the soundbar working again. Power**Off** the soundbar and then press and hold the**Play/Pause** button on it until it displays**INIT OK** . Then release the button and power the soundbar**On** again. You'll have to walk through the steps for pairing the soundbar to your TV again.

 FAQ

* How do I connect a Samsung soundbar to a TV?  
 To[connect a Samsung soundbar to a TV](https://www.lifewire.com/connect-samsung-soundbar-to-tv-5217392) , gather the soundbar's included power cable, HDMI cable, and optical cable. Connect the soundbar to power and then connect the soundbar to your TV via the HDMI connection. Alternatively, use an optical cable if using an optical connection.
