## Fixes to try

 You may not try them. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that brings the best game performance.

1. **[Change the PC power plan](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Modify the config file](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver is essential to a smooth and enhanced gaming experience. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you’re more likely to get Skyrim FPS drops. So to avoid this, you should check for the driver updates regularly.

There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually:** If you know the exact model of your graphics card, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website:[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) . Then search for the most recent driver that’s compatible with your operating system and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the_flagged graphics driver_ to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

### Fix 4 – Roll back your AMD graphics driver

 AMD users reported the latest AMD graphics driver can trigger decreased performance in Skyrim. To see if that’s the cause, you could roll back your graphics driver to the previous version.

 DDU is a solid fix for driver installation problems but it might not work for all cases. To get rid of potential risk, you’d better[create a restore point](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) beforehand.

Here is the instruction:

1. Download and install[Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU)](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) .
2. Restart your computer in[Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
3. Launch DDU and select**GPU** and your**graphics card brand** on the main screen.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/clean-reinstall-driver-1.jpg)
4. Click**Clean and restart** .

5. Wait for the uninstalling process to complete. Then, reboot your PC to exit the safe mode.
6. Go to the official support website of[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) to download the previous version of your graphics card driver.
7. Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver manually.
