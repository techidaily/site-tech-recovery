## How to Fix Mss32.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.

 Don't download mss32.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons[why downloading a DLL file like that is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore mss32.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" mss32.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
![mss32.dll file in recycle bin](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BFreI6joymY1ydAOY-pM5YboEAU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/mss32-dll-recycle-bin-restore-dcd0746c1f1a444c8cc4ca0999ab2820.png)  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free file recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) . But only do this if you're sure you deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before that.

[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete any of these steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Reinstall the program that uses the mss32.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Steam is a common application that experiences mss32.dll errors, so if that's the program you're seeing the DLL error in,[reinstalling Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) may prove to be very helpful.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the mss32.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
3. [Verify the integrity of the Steam game cache](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB) . This step is clearly only applicable if your mss32.dll errors are related to a Steam game.  
 If this step doesn't clear the error, navigate to the folder on your computer that the game files are stored in, delete the "bin" folder, and then re-verify the game cache.[Follow these instructions from Steam Community](https://web.archive.org/web/20170603075515/http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=33249463&postcount=8) (that's an archived version of the page) for more specific steps on doing that.
4. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some mss32.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
5. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to this DLL file. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file mss32.dll is missing" error when you play a video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[sound card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-sound-card-2618160) .  
 The mss32.dll file may or may not be related to your sound card drivers or software installationâ€”this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
6. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if mss32.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
8. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any mss32.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

## Causes of Mss32.dll Error Messages

 In some cases, mss32.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue, or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure, but chances are the file is just corrupt or missing.
