## Exploring Our Picks: The 8 Leading Multi-SIM Communication Tools

Alternate phone numbers are great for privacy. You get[control over who gets your phone number](https://www.lifewire.com/hide-your-number-with-star-67-4154833) , freedom from robocalls, and more. We've compiled a list of the best second phone number apps. Some are free, others are not, but all are available on iOS and Android.

 Our Top Picks

## Google Voice

<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BBusiness%2B970x90%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/business-970x90.gif" border="0"></a>

![Google Voice app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QD8AtRrVkii3K5b6NIDmBqxBp6A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleVoice-c01155b27d924892b0c519fea700bc5e.jpg)

 What We Like

* Full web interface.
* Free with no ads.
* Tied to your Google account.
* Anonymous caller ID option.
* Voicemail transcripts.
* Do Not Disturb mode to force calls to go to voicemail.

 What We Don't Like

* More data for Google to play with.
* Rocky future since Google kills products on a whim.
* Available from only a dozen or so countries.

[Google Voice](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-voice-1616888) has a complicated existence. It has been around for a long time but hasn't had many significant updates over the years. Given Google's history of building and then removing products, take from that what you will. But, the best part of this app is it's completely free.

 It's easy to use and it even has a web interface. One thing that makes Voice unique is that it can be set up to[ring multiple devices at once so you never miss a call](https://www.lifewire.com/obtain-phone-number-that-rings-on-multiple-phones-3426655) . You can make calls from the web as well as send texts and listen to voice messages. Google Voice even comes with a spam filter for messages and voicemails, which can help you sort through them.

 Like most free second number apps, Voice will recycle your number if you don't use it. But, we don't see this as a con because you're warned about it a few times before you lose access. Plus, you just need to send a text every now and then to keep it active.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/google-voice/id318698524)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googlevoice)

## TextFree

![TextFree settings and messages screens on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/unDAtc5gFOJPT6jHFAI9rdfvRo0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/TextFree-8812f9d9da3040e4858c9c2532641fa1.jpg)

 What We Like

* Works over Wi-Fi.
* Free to use with ads.
* Lots of options, like auto-reply and custom wallpapers and ringtones.
* Does not require an existing phone number.

 What We Don't Like

* Frequency requirement.
* Multiple subscriptions.
* Bad UI.
* Must pay to unlock verification code texts.

 Text Free is another absolutely free phone number service, with a catch. The catch is that you have to continuously use the phone number or it may be reclaimed. If a number goes unused for more than 30 days, you lose the number. You can pay a subscription to keep the number active even if you rarely use it.

 There are also ads everywhere, but for another subscription fee, you can remove them. The app has a navigation system based heavily on the back button, which is never ideal, but it also works over Wi-Fi, so there's no SIM required.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-free-texting-calling/id399355755)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinger.textfree)

## Cloud SIM

![Cloud Sim app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Srj9u1FpW2I3Z-KmmiJjUQlmlkQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/CloudSIM-07ceafd5f44f47e5955e365b0b2443db.jpg)

 What We Like

* Free to call/text other users.
* Fun interface.

 What We Don't Like

* Not free to call any non-CloudSIM user.
* Limited to the U.S., Canada, UK, and Poland.

 Cloud SIM is a service that is great if you have a lot of friends using it, but it's not great at all if you don't. Phone calls and texts are charged by the minute or message if you're not messaging a Cloud SIM user. The app's user interface is fun, with a circular set of buttons for accessing various features, but it comes at the cost of being intuitive. Plus, there is no free trial at all; you're either all in, or all out.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/cloud-sim/id1141422197)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudsimapp.vtl)

## Sideline

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Sideline app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/nTUI6xGBYRLnWLH-GtVdMQ5_oKI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Sideline-a296ece7bd0449158069f6543016eeb7.jpg)

 What We Like

* Uses carrier signal, not VoIP.
* Simple interface.
* Port in your existing phone number.

 What We Don't Like

* Only a 7-day trial.
* No free option beyond the trial.
* Expensive.

 Sideline gives you a second phone number, while still using your carrier's messaging and voice calling minutes. The benefit is there is no uncertainty when it comes to coverage. If your phone has a signal, you can dial out. The app itself is intuitive but reliant on back buttons. Your new number includes calling, texting, and voicemail.

 The app offers a 7-day free trial, but no other free option after that. An interesting option allows you to port a number from a different phone into Sideline. If you have a second phone already, you can use that number with Sideline and ditch the second phone altogether.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sideline-2nd-phone-number/id1012032539)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sideline.phone.number)

## Burner

![Burner app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pEe0ri89DKPwCOJwhQv3UXBH9DI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Burner-877a38ce01bb41399111f7bd07cbbd42.jpg)

 What We Like

* Auto-reply to texts.
* Up to three active lines.
* Unlimited calls and texts on each line.

 What We Don't Like

* Free only during the trial.
* Pesky calls to action.
* Works only in the US and Canada.

 Burner is exactly like it sounds: it's a burner phone number for you to use, and then burn. When you burn a number, it gets wiped from your phone and taken out of service. You can have multiple second numbers at a time, each operating independently.

 When you get your first number, you're asked to give it a name. If you don't, you'll be asked again. You will be asked a lot. Also, user guides are preloaded into the app as notifications, which is not ideal.

 You get a 7-day free trial like many others; there is no free option.  

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id505800761)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adhoclabs.burner)

## FreeTone

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![FreeTone's numbers, store, and inbox screens on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/27vE-FmM5x8utnFLiWErYsdEEQ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/FreeTone-04fa76e3d0644bd09f7e33b300fb2d3a.jpg)

 What We Like

* Free to use with ads.
* Web app (with premium).

 What We Don't Like

* iOS version costs.
* OMG there are ads.
* Interface is clunky.
* Holy cow, those ads.

 FreeTone gives you one free phone number from any area code, and you can use that number if you agree to ads. In most cases, there are at least two ads on the screen at any time: during phone calls, inside your text message thread, or in your contacts.

 Of course, if you're willing to put up with all the ads, you're in good shape. If you don't or if you want more than one phone number, you'll need to subscribe. You can choose from weekly or monthly subscriptions and buy credits if you don't want a recurring fee. Overall, it's versatile, has a web app, and works over Wi-Fi without a[SIM card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-sim-cards-577532) .

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/free-tone-calling-texting/id338088432)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textmeinc.freetone)

## Hushed

![Hushed app on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/sFHL5XFGz0mc8RM75vDmeaHmP0o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Hushed-abeb81a8066d445f8e8bde25aff767f3.jpg)

 What We Like

* Flexible subscription options.
* Lots of customization options.

 What We Don't Like

* No free trial.
* The UI is just... no.
* Pricey, unless you do unlimited.

 Hushed is another privacy-focused service that gives you an independent, easily disposable phone number for texting and calling. It comes with a wide variety of options in terms of subscription and payments from per-call/text plans up to unlimited plans. If you go with a per-call or per-text plan, the costs add up pretty quickly.

 The user interface definitely leaves something to be desired. Not only is it a dark theme, which some won't mind, but the icons and UI look a little outdated. They're certainly not anything approaching modern or attractive. Texting includes very limited options as well.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hushed-second-phone-number/id600520752)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hushed.release)

## Dingtone

![Dingtone messages, phone number, and earn credits screens on Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/LtsMsUAcxV0mRLXnGg8wJW5i3cQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Dingtone-1079cdaa753c442981e227f98ca22227.jpg)

 What We Like

* Automatically detects your phone number.
* Port your number.
* Credit gamification.

 What We Don't Like

* Credits required to call or text.
* Credit uncertainty.
* Frequency requirement.

 Dingtone is another free app you can use to make calls and texts, but there are some caveats here. Rather than ads, Dingtone has gamified the app using a credit system. You can buy credits if you want. Otherwise, there are various ways you can earn credits by playing games or checking into the app daily. It's an interesting concept, but ultimately a little confusing.

 You need credits to make calls and send texts, but it doesn't say how many you need for each. It doesn't say if it's per message, per day, per minute, or something else. Plus, you need to use your number every ten days and maintain a credit balance of at least one, or you could lose it. It's a bit much and it almost makes ads sound desirable.

 Premium unlocks extra features like call recording, but also paywalls normal functions like call blocking, visual voicemail, and call forwarding. There's also a neat walkie-talkie feature.

**Download For:**

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/dingtone-free-phone-calls/id588937297)

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.dingtone.app.im)
