## What if there’s no sound from TV speakers?

 If you can’t hear the audio from your TV, make sure the sound isn’t muted, and that the volume is set properly both on your laptop and TV.

In addition, set your HDMI audio output device as the default device.

 1) Right-click on the sound icon at the bottom right on your laptop’s screen. Then click**Playback devices** .

### Still No Sound?

 If after all the settings above, there’s still no sound from your TV’s speakers, we highly recommend you update your HDMI audio output device driver. You can choose to download the latest driver from your device manufacturer’s website. However, it’s not as easy as it sounds. It needs you to find the correct driver and download it all manually.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the **Scan Now** button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click **Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or automatically with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
