[Passkeys](https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-location-on-life360-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) are alternatives to passwords and make signing in to your favorite websites and apps faster. We'll show you how to generate, use, view, and delete passkeys on your Windows 11 PC.

##  What Is a Passkey?

 A passkey is a replacement for your website or app account password. When you create a passkey with your favorite site or app, you can use your device's authentication method to log in to that site or app.

 For example, with Windows 11, you can use the [Windows Hello](https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-capturing-brilliance-essential-angles-in-iphone-photography/) functionality to sign in to various services. This means you can use your PIN, [facial recognition](https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/install-or-enhance-your-hp-laserjet-m5100m6m7-printer-with-recent-driver-versions/), or fingerprint scanning to log in to multiple services and apps.

 Passkeys have multiple advantages over passwords. The main one is that, unlike passwords, it is borderline impossible to steal passkeys. Another advantage is that passkeys are almost completely impervious to phishing. It is relatively easy to trick a human into entering a password on a fake website, but passkeys aren't so easily fooled. 

##  What Platforms Support Passkeys?

 Many popular sites and apps support passkeys, as this is a quick and convenient way to log in. Some services that support this feature are:

* Adobe
* [Amazon](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-the-new-frontier-a-comparative-study-on-tiktok-and-triller-for-2024/)
* Apple
* [Google](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-easy-path-to-cleaning-up-conversations-bulk-deletion-on-discord/)
* LinkedIn
* Microsoft
* WhatsApp
* X (formerly Twitter)

##  How to Create and Save a Passkey to Your Windows 11 PC

 To generate and save a passkey, you'll first visit your favorite website or app’s account settings. From there, you’ll create the key and then save it to your PC. In this guide, we’ll demonstrate how to do that with a Google account.

 Begin by launching Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Brave web browser on your PC. Head to [Google’s My Account site](https://myaccount.google.com/) and sign in to your account.

 After logging in, from the left sidebar, select "Security." On the right pane, scroll down to the "How You Sign In to Google" section and choose "Passkeys and Security Keys."

 Google will likely prompt you to enter your account password. Do so and continue.

 When the following page opens, at the top, click "Create a Passkey."

 And that’s how you make signing in to sites and apps faster and more convenient on your Windows 11 PC. Remember to [set up two-factor authentication](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-premiere-visionary-film-glimpses/) on all of your important accounts, too!
