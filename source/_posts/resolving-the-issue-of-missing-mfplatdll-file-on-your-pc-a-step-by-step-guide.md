 The d3dx9\_25.dll file is one of many files that make up the DirectX software collection. D3dx9\_25.dll errors usually appear when a software program utilizing DirectX can't find use that DLL file correctly.

 Information in this article applies to all Microsoft [operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including [Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) , [Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) , [Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) , [Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) , [Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix D3dx9\_25.dll Errors

 If[rebooting your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) doesn't solve the problem, try these solutions in order until the issue is fixed:

 Do not download d3dx9\_25.dll. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file from a "DLL download" website is not recommended](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of this file, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Install the latest version of Microsoft DirectX](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-download-install-directx-2624489) . Upgrading DirectX will fix most d3dx9\_25.dll errors.  
![DirectX download page on Microsoft's website](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vjo1C3LC3FQCKtRxOu0VME3mbzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_fix-d3dx9-25-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623270-8432b81f362e460a95c8b59dce23eae9.jpg)  
 Microsoft often releases updates to DirectX without changing the[version number](https://www.lifewire.com/version-number-2626043) or letter, so be sure to install the latest release even if your version is technically the same. The same DirectX installation program works with all versions of Windows and will replace any missing DirectX files.
2. Install the version of DirectX that came with the program. Look for a DirectX installation program on your game or application CD or DVD.  
 If a program utilizes DirectX, the software developers will often include an installable copy of DirectX on the setup disc. Sometimes, the DirectX version included on the disc will work better with the program than the latest version available online.
3. [Reinstall the program](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) that's showing the error. This will sometimes replace the missing or corrupted d3dx9\_25.dll file.  
![Uninstall apps in the Windows settings](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Pg9CEirWQ4FlHkbSfROHbh0olUY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/003_fix-d3dx9-25-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623270-00161881ea924f7dae33afcb1ad7d468.jpg)
4. [Restore the missing DirectX files](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516) . You can do this by extracting them individually from the DirectX package.
5. [Update your video card drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . Outdated or corrupted[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) can sometimes cause DirectX issues.  
![Update driver option on the Windows Device Manager menu](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-oyKYAq8sXdsMC1KcKO7VpcPEQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/005_fix-d3dx9-25-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623270-a5d117505a23436fbf5b2b2396d2eceb.jpg)
6. Use a [free hard drive testing program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) to check for [hardware-related DLL errors](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) . If a problem is detected, replace the hardware component as soon as possible, or take your PC to a professional [computer repair service](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-get-my-computer-fixed-2625167) .
