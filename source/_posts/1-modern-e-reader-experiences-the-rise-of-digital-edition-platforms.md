Using Adobe 4.5.11 Digital Editions. Pdf is downloaded, ADE is installed, trying to remove the DRM from the pdf file, but I keep on getting "Information is incorrect, please try again" error.

In Adobe digital editions, the book is 481 pages, but after conversion in Mobi it only shows 85 pages. where is the rest of the book?

[Several paragraphs are missing from the DRM removed pdf](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/16/2020 2:33:55 AM 

Software removed the DRM from a book in Adobe Digital editions. The generated pdf has a blank (should be page 24) and so is missing text. The text is there in the ADE version of the file.

[Conversion not working](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 1/25/2024 2:01:49 PM 

Hello,  
 I have converted a book purchased via ebooks.com, loaded into my Adobe Digital Editions app, and then put it through epubor Ultimate v3.0.13.120\. However, when I try to add this book to my Calibre 7.4.0 bookshelf, Calibre tells me this book is DRM protected.  
 This is the first time I have had a problem. Have been using your product for many years now. The book is readable within ADE, but not Calibre it seems.  
 Can you help. I am using a MacBook V14.2.1  
 Thanks  
 Katrina
