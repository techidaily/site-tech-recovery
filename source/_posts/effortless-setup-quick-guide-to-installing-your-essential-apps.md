[Kindle for PC App Updating Automatially (without permission)](http://www.epubor.com/kindle-for-pc-app-updating-automatially-without-permission.html) \-- 10/24/2020 10:51:45 AM 

Hi Everyone, I've got a Kindle question I'm hoping someone can help with. I use the Kindle for PC app (Australia) to download books I buy so I can back them up. I have cleared the 'automatic update' box, but this morning it still updated without my permission. It will now not let me downgrade, and no matter which version of the app I download, when it is installed it is the current version 1.30\. I'm using Windows 10\.   
 I'm stuck, any suggestions?

I need help reinstalling Epubor Ultimate on my laptop, that is now running Windows 10\. The Program will not work after the update to windows 10\. I tried updating the version of Epubor Ultimate that I was running both through the program itself and through the link on the website.

I'm using Kindle 1.17; I can't download a recently purchased kindle. When I attempt to download, the following message is displayed:

[Kindle registration page stuck in eternal reload loop](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 7/20/2021 8:38:14 AM 

I have Windows 10\. I bought Epubor Ultimate. It told me I had to install an earlier version of the Kindle App. With Epubor's assitance, it downloaded and installed Kindle version 1.24.51068\. The app works fine UNTIL I go to register it with Amazon. It just loops the login screen over and over nonstop. The reload is so fast I can't even type a single letter.

 Suggestions? This software is useless to me unless I can get to my Kindle books I've purchased.

[Unable to remove Nook DRM](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/14/2019 8:41:24 AM 

I have downloaded Epubor and trying to remove the DRM from a Nook book that I had recently purchased. I went through the steps on https://www.epubor.com/faq.html#e303 and downloaded/installed Nook Study but was unable to login. I am not sure what I am not doing correctly unless it is that I have to purchase the licensed version of Epubor. If that is the case, I will do so, but I wanted to test it out first to make sure it will remove the Nook DRM.

[Epubor It doesn't work in my Mac with Catalina](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/22/2020 6:47:49 PM 

I have bought Epubor Ultimate for Mac and It doesn't work.I read later that I should buy KCR converter, but on its website it does not clearly state that it does not work in catalina. If i download and install KCR converter, my question is: Can I use the same purchase license? It really works in Catalina? If Epubor Ultimate doesn't work for me, could you return the money to buy the other software??  
 Please I need a solution

[Kindle Transfer Won't start](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/transfer/) \-- 6/1/2016 3:44:35 AM 

I installed Kindle Transfer with no problem. When I try to start it I get a message stating "A New Version is Ready. Click "OK" to Confirm Updating, Then Manually Open the Software Again."

[Licence key](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 11/23/2021 6:36:48 AM 

Hi,

 I want to avail the free 30 day trail for Epubor before I buy the full version. However, upon installing the software, it is asking for a licence key for me to be able to try it. Where can I find that for a trial version?

 Thanks

[Can't decrypt Kindle books anymore](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/11/2019 11:46:51 PM 

Hi there, today I opened my Kindle for PC app and I was unable to decrypt a book. Something has changed with the software, so I tried downloading the 1.24 version as I have done before, but with no luck. Epubor cannot decrypt correctly, it basically creates a version of the ebook in HTMLZ, which lacks some essential features, such as the index. I tried installing the older version multiple times, both the 1.24 and the 1.17 but nothing changes.

[Copy functions from Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/7/2016 10:45:43 PM 

Calibre's success majorly depends on those varieties of plugin in my personal point of view. No-doubt the Alf's DRM Removal plugins are the super stars among them. But many people are saying the Calibre's interface and user-experience are not that friendly for tech noobs. No mention the plugin installation, which would be another challenge for them.

[after update, epubor won't open](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/16/2021 1:51:04 AM 

Since last week, epubor was failing at converting my files so I found an update. But now it's even worse, epubor won't even open. I deleted the app, downloaded it again, reinstalled it. Same thing. The app won't open anymore.
