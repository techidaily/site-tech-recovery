## How to Fix STOP 0x0000007B Errors

 Some of these steps may require you to[access Windows via Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) . Just skip those steps if that's not possible.

1. [Restart your computer](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-reboot-a-computer-2624568) if you haven't already done so. The STOP 0x0000007B blue screen error might be a fluke.  
![Restart Windows 10 PC](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6CTZiV6xDkGZI7BTsLaucfk5k0g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/restartWindows10-7722f41a53714d9ba98b4d59e1614b6c.jpg)
2. Did you just install or make a change to a hard drive controller? If so, there's a good chance that the change you made caused the STOP 0x0000007B error. Undo the change and test for the 0x7B blue screen error.  
 Depending on what changes you made, some solutions might include:  
   * Removing or reconfiguring the newly installed hard drive controller  
   * [Starting up with Last Known Good Configuration](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-start-windows-7-using-last-known-good-configuration-2626308) to undo related[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) and driver changes  
   * [Using System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) to undo recent changes  
   * [Rolling back the hard drive controller device driver](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) to the version prior to your driver update
3. [Verify that the SCSI chain is correctly terminated](https://web.archive.org/web/20181208051243/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/if/scsi/cablesTermination-c.html) , assuming you're using[SCSI](https://www.lifewire.com/small-computer-system-interface-scsi-2626002) hard drives in your computer. Incorrect SCSI termination has been known to cause STOP 0x0000007B errors.  
 Most home computers don't utilize SCSI hard drives but instead[PATA](https://www.lifewire.com/parallel-ata-pata-2625957) or[SATA](https://www.lifewire.com/serial-ata-sata-2626009) .
4. Verify that the hard drive is properly installed. An improperly installed hard drive could cause this error and other issues.
5. [Verify that the hard drive is configured properly in BIOS](https://web.archive.org/web/20181212064707/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/bios/biosSettings-c.html) . The STOP 0x0000007B error could occur if the hard drive settings in[BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/bios-basic-input-output-system-2625820) are incorrect.
6. [Scan your computer for viruses](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Certain malware that infects the[master boot record](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-master-boot-record-mbr-2625936) (MBR) or[boot sector](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-boot-sector-2625815) can cause STOP 0x0000007B errors.  
 Make sure your virus scanning software is updated and configured to scan the MBR and boot sector. See our[Best Free Antivirus Software](https://www.lifewire.com/best-free-antivirus-software-4151895) list if you don't already have one.
7. [Update the drivers for your hard drive controller](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) . If the drivers to your hard drive controller are outdated, incorrect, or corrupted, the STOP 0x0000007B error will likely occur.  
 If the error occurs during the Windows setup process and you suspect that the reason is driver related, be sure to install the latest hard drive controller driver from the manufacturer for use during the installation of the[operating system](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) .  
 This is a likely solution if the second[hexadecimal number](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-hexadecimal-2625897) _after_ the STOP code is 0xC0000034.
8. Change the SATA mode in BIOS to[IDE](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ide-cable-2625908) mode. Disabling some of the advanced features of SATA drives in BIOS could stop the STOP 0x0000007B error from showing up, especially if you're seeing it in Windows XP or during a Windows XP installation.  
 Depending on your BIOS make and version, SATA mode may be referred to as_AHCI mode_ and IDE mode may be referred to as either_Legacy_ ,_ATA_ , or_Compatibility Mode_ .  
 While not a common solution, you might also want to try the reverse: see if IDE mode is selected in BIOS and if so, change it to AHCI, especially if you see the STOP 0x0000007B error in Windows 10, 8, 7, or Vista.  
 If you see this STOP error_after making the BIOS change_ on a Windows 7 or Vista computer, you might need to enable the AHCI disk driver. See [Microsoft's instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/922976/error-message-occurs-after-you-change-the-sata-mode-of-the-boot-drive) on making that change in Windows Registry.
9. [Run chkdsk on your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/chkdsk-command-2625838) . If the boot volume is corrupted, the chkdsk command might repair the corruption.  
 You'll likely have to run chkdsk from the[Recovery Console](https://www.lifewire.com/recovery-console-2625991) .  
 This will likely be the solution if the second hexadecimal number_after_ the STOP code is 0xC0000032.
10. [Perform an extensive test of your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . If your hard drive has a physical problem, one very likely situation is the STOP 0x0000007B error you're seeing.  
[Replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) if the diagnostics you complete suggest that there is a hardware problem with the drive.
11. [Run the fixmbr command](https://www.lifewire.com/fixmbr-command-2625887) to create a new master boot record. A corrupted master boot record might be causing your STOP 0x0000007B error.  
 This will likely be the solution if the second hexadecimal number_after_ the STOP code is 0xC000000E.
12. [Clear the CMOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cmos-2624545) . Sometimes the STOP 0x0000007B error is caused by a BIOS memory issue. Clearing the CMOS could solve that problem.
13. [Update your BIOS](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-bios-4783238) . In some situations, an outdated BIOS could cause this error due to incompatibilities with a hard drive controller.
14. Update the hard drive controller's[firmware](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-firmware-2625881) if possible. Just as with the BIOS in the previous step, an incompatibility could be causing the 0x7B error and a firmware update from the manufacturer may correct the problem.
15. [Repair your Windows installation](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If you've just replaced the[motherboard](https://www.lifewire.com/motherboards-system-boards-and-mainboards-2618154) in a computer without reinstalling Windows then this will likely fix your problem.  
![Repair Windows screen](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/F11Jk0jxq6MD66N_WFyvaIvuTag=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/repairwindows-5ddd983ddbee4fa5ab34fe8d57eb61ec.jpg)  
 Sometimes a Windows repair will not fix a STOP 0x0000007B error. In those cases, a[clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) should do the trick.  
 If you haven't just replaced your motherboard, a Windows reinstall probably_will not_ fix your STOP 0x7B issue.
16. [Perform basic STOP error troubleshooting](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-a-blue-screen-of-death-2624518) . If none of the specific steps above help fix the STOP 0x0000007B error you're seeing, take a look at this general STOP error troubleshooting guide. Since most STOP errors are similarly caused, some of the suggestions might help.

## Causes of the STOP 0x0000007B Errors

 One of the errors below, or a combination of both errors, might display on the STOP message:

 STOP: 0x0000007BINACCESSIBLE\_BOOT\_DEVICE  

 The STOP 0x0000007B error may also be abbreviated as STOP 0x7B, but the full[STOP code](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-stop-code-2625685) will always be what's displayed on the blue screen STOP message.

 If Windows is able to start after the STOP 0x7B error, you might be prompted with a_Windows has recovered from an unexpected shutdown_ message that shows:

 Problem Event Name: BlueScreenBCCode: 7b  

 STOP 0x0000007B errors are caused by[device driver](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) issues (especially those related to[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and other storage controllers), viruses, data corruption, and sometimes even[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failures.

 Any of Microsoft's Windows NT based operating systems could experience this error. This includes[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) ,[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , Windows 2000, and Windows NT.

 If STOP 0x0000007B isn't the exact STOP code you're seeing or INACCESSIBLE\_BOOT\_DEVICE isn't the exact message, check our[Complete List of STOP Error Codes](https://www.lifewire.com/blue-screen-error-codes-4065576) and reference the troubleshooting information for the STOP message that you are seeing.
