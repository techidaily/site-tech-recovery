## Method 1: Disable Fast Startup

```` `` The first quick and easy method to solve the problem is to disable Fast Startup on your Windows 10 device.

 Fast Startup is a default-enabled feature in Windows 10\. It is supposed to reduce startup time by pre-loading some boot information before your PC shuts off. It works similarly as Hibernation. But many users have reported it’s causing issues.

```` `` 1) Type **power option**  in the search box at Start, then click **Power & Sleep settings** .

## Method 2: Disable Processes with High Startup Impact

```` `` **Note:**  Except for the crucial security software.

```` ``

```` `` 1) On your keyboard, press the**Shift**  \+ **Ctrl** +**Esc** keys at the same  time to open **Task Manager** .

## Method 3: Update your graphics card driver

 If there are any old or corrupted drivers on your Windows 10 PC, this can cause your computer to boot slowly. You can update your device drivers to solve your problem.

```` ``

```` `` You can do this manually by downloading the latest drivers  from your graphics card manufacturer’s official website. You’ll need to find exactly the correct driver, though.  If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  or if you want to save some time, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do it automatically.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. Your sound driver is no exception.

**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
