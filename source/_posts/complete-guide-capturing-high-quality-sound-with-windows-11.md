![A recording file highlighted in File Explorer.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/7-sound-recorder-audio-file.jpg) 

 By default, Sound Recorder saves recordings in the [M4A](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-gastronomy-gurus-essential-chefs-to-subscribe-to-for-2024/) format. If you want to change this to a more popular format like [MP3](https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-turning-insta-vids-into-music-your-complete-guide/), in the app’s top-right corner, click the three dots and choose "Settings."

 Sound Recorder automatically saves your changes, so you don’t have to click any buttons.

##  With Audacity - A Free and Open-Source App

 If you want more powerful audio editing features and multi-track recording, Audacity is the answer. It’s a free and open-source audio recording app that’s been around for a long time. 

 To use Audacity, launch a web browser on your PC and head to [the official Audacity website](https://www.audacityteam.org/). Download and install the app on your computer, then launch it.

 Once you open Audacity, first, choose the mic that you want to use. Pick your mic by navigating to Audio Setup > Recording Device in the top toolbar and selecting your preferred mic.

 To start recording, click Record (a red button) on the top toolbar, or press the R key.

![The Record button highlighted in Audacity.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/12-audacity-start-recording.jpg) 

 Audacity is now listening, so speak into your mic. If you wish to pause the recording, click the Pause button or press P. To stop the recording, click the Stop button.

![Pause and Stop buttons highlighted in Audacity.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/13-audacity-pause-stop-recording.jpg) 

 Unlike Sound Recorder, Audacity doesn’t save recordings automatically. You have two ways to save your recorded audio in the app.

 The first way is to save your entire Audacity audio project. This retains any edits you’ve made to your recorded audio. To do this, from the app’s menu bar, select File > Save Project > Save Project. Later, you can open this project and resume your editing.

 If you only wish to save your recording, from the menu bar, select File > Export Audio.

!['Export Audio' highlighted in Audacity's 'File' menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/14-audacity-export-audio.jpg)

 In the Export Audio window, click "Browse" and choose the location and the file name for the audio file. Click the "Format" drop-down menu and choose your preferred audio format for the file. You should choose MP3 if you’re unsure what to select, as this format plays on nearly all devices. 

 If you’d like, configure the other options, then click "Export" at the bottom.

!['Browse,' 'Format,' and 'Export' highlighted on the 'Export Audio' window.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/15-audacity-save-recording.jpg) 

 Audacity has saved the recording file in the chosen folder. You’re all set.

 If you want to [record your PC’s system sound](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-steps-on-how-to-create-a-new-apple-id-account-on-iphone-12-pro-by-drfone-ios/), like the sound of error messages, games, and apps, rather than your microphone, there are a few ways to do it. Happy recording!
