## Top Strategies for Finding a Match on Bumble When You Keep Getting No Hits

Close 

 It can be a lot of fun to hop on Bumble and start swiping right on profiles of people you think you might like. Unfortunately, if nobody swipes right on your profile, you won't get any matches.

 Before you abandon Bumble for a[ different free dating site](https://www.lifewire.com/five-ways-to-meet-people-online-3482695) , keep reading to learn why nobody is matching with you and what you can do about it.

[ How to Use Bumble ](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-bumble-4570804) 

##  Causes of No Matches on Bumble 

 There are four common reasons for not receiving matches on Bumble:

* **Your profile hasn't been filled out properly** : You've left a lot of details blank, which keeps your profile from being shown to the most relevant users. Maybe you only have a photo or two that doesn't show off how great you look, so it doesn't catch users' attention enough and they end up swiping left to pass.
* **Your settings aren't configured right** : You can choose up to two filters (with a free account) to help you find the most relevant matches. You can also expand or narrow your distance for the locations of the profiles you see.
* **You're picky with who you swipe right on** : You could be missing out on matches without even knowing it because you're only swiping right on the best of the best profiles that you come across.
* **You're not a good fit for Bumble** : Bumble users are typically looking for serious relationships, so if your profile suggests the opposite, this might explain why you're getting passed over.

##  How to Fix an Improperly Filled Out Profile 

 If you were quick to fill out your Bumble profile or skipped it altogether, try the following:

1. From the**Profile** tab, tap your picture and then choose**Edit profile** .
2. Make sure your profile is verified since some users can choose to not view unverified accounts. If your Bumble account is unverified, tap**Verify my profile** .  
 You'll be asked to upload a photo of yourself making a specific hand gesture.
3. Upload good-quality photos of yourself and aim to fill up all six slots.  
![The verify and photo upload screens in the Bumble app for Android](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/noeiM1buKxRujCjawLd1Eeo__aY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/bumble-upload-pictures-verify-account-e5f20542aa284af99af144786e9ac4db.png)  
 Choose photos of yourself smiling in different settings and avoid using any group photos or pictures that hide your face (avoid sunglasses, shadows, etc).
4. Scroll down the settings page to the**Prompts** section and tap**Add a prompt** . Answer these questions to help make your personality stand out.  
 You can only show three prompts at a time, but you can also experiment with different ones by swapping them out and seeing whether one increases your chances of getting matches.
5. Fill out everything in the**Bio** ,**About you** , and**More about you** sections. An empty bio is a red flag for some people, and the more potential matches know about you right off the bat (by filling out these sections), the better!

##  How to Fix Your Bumble Settings 

 It's important to select the most relevant filters for your profile searches so the right profiles appear for you (and vice versa). You might also consider expanding your desired age range and distance to increase your reach.

1. From the match tab, select the filter button at the top.
2. From the**Dating basics** tab, make sure you've chosen the right kind of person you're looking for.**I'm open to dating everyone** is the widest net you can cast, but you can be more specific depending on what you're after.
3. The**Age** filter is one you shouldn't overlook. Use the slider to pick a low and high age and optionally toggle the button to also see people two years younger or older than your selection.
4. **Distance** is another important parameter that could increase your matches on Bumble. Decide the furthest distance you're willing for your matches to be, or slide the distance to the right if you think you've run out of nearby users.
5. Switch to the**Advanced filters** tab and tap**Add this filter** next to any of them to narrow down who you're able to match with.

 If you're worried about bots and you think that's why you aren't getting matches, turn on**Verified profiles only** to just see people who have gone through the verification process.
6. Select**Apply** at the bottom when you're finished editing these settings.

##  How to Fix Your Bumble Swiping Habits 

 The only way to fix your super picky or strict swiping habits is by easing up a bit and being more generous with your right swipes. Remember that by doing so, you're just opening up the doors for communication—you don't necessarily need to do anything else if you find that the match doesn't take off. It will eventually expire if you stop communicating.

 You might also be interested in using[ Bumble SuperSwipes](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-bumble-superswipe-4799401) on certain profiles, which can increase your chances of a match. SuperSwipes are a premium feature that you can give to profiles to let them know you really like them.

##  How to Fix Being a Poor Fit for Bumble 

 It's important to understand that the majority of Bumble users are using the platform to make meaningful connections that eventually lead to serious commitment. If this isn't what you're looking for and your profile reflects it, you might consider trying a different[ popular dating app](https://www.lifewire.com/best-dating-apps-4173826) .

[ Bumble vs. Tinder ](https://www.lifewire.com/bumble-vs-tinder-4797367) 

 You might find that dating isn't what you're really looking for. Bumble includes a friend finder if you're not interested in dating right now, but there are[ other friend-finder apps we recommend](https://www.lifewire.com/best-apps-to-meet-people-and-make-friends-5082174) .

 FAQ

* Is there a daily limit on Bumble?  
 Bumble sets a limit on the number of people users can swipe on each day. However, there's no daily limit to the number of people who can swipe on your profile.
* Can I see who I swiped right on Bumble?  
 No. After you swipe right on someone, you'll only see their profile again if they also swipe right on you.
* What do Bumble matches see when I snooze my profile?  
 If your matches check their conversations, they'll see a notification that your profile is in snooze mode. No one new will see your profile while it's snoozed.
* Why do my Bumble matches disappear?  
 If a match disappears, it could be because they deleted their account or blocked you. Deleted accounts remain in your conversations for only a short time.
* How do I reset my Bumble matches?  
 The only way to reset your matches on Bumble is to delete your account and make a new one.
