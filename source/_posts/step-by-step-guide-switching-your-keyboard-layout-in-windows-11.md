##  How to Change Your Keyboard Language

 During the Windows 11 setup process, you'll be asked to choose your preferred keyboard language. This will become the default language for your computer. However, you can easily install additional keyboard languages and switch between them through the Windows Settings app.

 To add a keyboard language, press Windows+i to open the Settings app (there are other ways to [launch the Settings app on Windows](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-easy-ways-to-multiply-your-youtube-follower-base/)).

 Select "Time & Language" from the left sidebar, and then click "Language & Region" in the right pane.

##  How to Change Your Keyboard Layout

 Different languages have different keyboard layouts that are automatically installed when you install the language. However, the default layout for your language might not always be the best option for you.

 In this case, you can choose from different layouts available for your language and install the one that best fits your typing habits. To install a different layout for your language, open the "Settings" app and navigate to Time & Language > Language & Region.

 Click the three dots next to your language and select "Language Options" from the menu that appears.
