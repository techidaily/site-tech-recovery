##  What Are Steam Digital Gift Cards? 

 In addition to gifting games on Steam, you can send digital gift cards through email. Gift cards come in predetermined amounts from $5 to $100\. You even have the option to send a personalized message to the recipient.

 Gift cards can't be purchased using funds from your Steam wallet; you must use PayPal or a credit card. The recipient can return the gift card, in which case Steam will refund you for the purchase.

 Amounts are based on the sender's currency and then converted to the recipient's currency, so if you send someone a gift card in another country, check the exchange rate.

##  How to Gift Games on Steam
