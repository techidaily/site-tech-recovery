## Waiting for Your Snapchat Account to Be Reactivated

 According to Snapchat, it can take up to 24 hours for an account to reactivate. Accounts with a lot of data to recover (including friends, conversations, saved chats, Memories, and more) may take the longest to reactivate.

 If you submitted your account for deletion and tried to reactivate it shortly after that, Snapchat may not have completed the deactivation process before you tried reactivating again. If you verified your email address, you should have received an email confirming deletion/deactivation.

 If, after more than 24 hours of waiting, you still can't log into your Snapchat account,[try these Snapchat troubleshooting tips](https://www.lifewire.com/is-snapchat-not-working-or-is-it-just-you-4174077) or try[reaching out to Snapchat customer service](https://www.lifewire.com/contact-snapchat-customer-service-4584117) to get their support team to look into the issue for you.
