 Everybody watches YouTube, but that isn't the only source of free, original, uploaded video content. Vimeo offers thousands of videos from many sources, including aspiring amateur filmmakers. The best way to get started is by checking out Vimeo's staff picks. Categories include music videos, short documentaries, comedy, and more.

* View online web shows and podcasts.
* Upload your own movies, music, photos, and more.
* Easy-to-use interface.

 What We Don't Like

You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).

 If you have a Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV and can[stream in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , check out UltraFlix for free and paid 4K content.

 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.

 Like YouTube and Instagram Video, Facebook Watch lets you watch user-generated videos on your big-screen Samsung TV. The videos are grouped into easy-to-navigate categories: Live Videos, Videos You've Shared, Videos Shared by Friends, Videos You've Uploaded, Videos from Pages You Follow, Facebook Watch Originals, and more.

 What We Don't Like

* Although cable subscription isn't required, you still have to pay a subscription fee via the app.
* Doesn't duplicate HBO's live cable feed.
* Need a premium subscription to view content ad-free.

 You don't need a cable or satellite subscription to get HBO. With a subscription to Max, you can enjoy all of the popular programs and movies offered by HBO on your Samsung Smart TV via the Internet. Here is your chance if you haven't seen_Game of Thrones_ or_Our Flag Means Death_ .

[Download Max](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG16040006493)
