You might be surprised at what you'll discover among the many apps available. Some apps are quite helpful, such as news, weather, education, and other information, and game apps can be fun.

 Here's a list that will help you decide which ones you want to try.

 Roku is well-known for its[streaming sticks, boxes, and smart TVs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-roku-4142216) , but it also offers a streaming app for other devices, including select Samsung TVs.

 What We Don't Like

 Everybody watches YouTube, but that isn't the only source of free, original, uploaded video content. Vimeo offers thousands of videos from many sources, including aspiring amateur filmmakers. The best way to get started is by checking out Vimeo's staff picks. Categories include music videos, short documentaries, comedy, and more.

* View online web shows and podcasts.
* Upload your own movies, music, photos, and more.
* Easy-to-use interface.

 What We Don't Like

 PLEX provides a way to organize your content so it can be easily accessed on your Samsung smart TV. This allows you to play any compatible media content stored on your computer on your TV. You just have to make sure that you have the PLEX app installed on your TV and the PLEX media server software installed on your computer. You're ready to go once you have the app and media server installed.

 The basic app is free, but you can upgrade to PLEX Premium ($4.99 mo, $39.99 yr, $119.99 lifetime). This lets you watch and record live TV on your computer or in the cloud (antenna and tuner required, as well as the ability to sync your content with compatible mobile devices).

* Built-in rating system.
* Decent selection of free movies to watch.

* Available only in the US, Canada, and Europe.

 If you have a Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV and can[stream in 4K](https://www.lifewire.com/4k-resolution-overview-and-perspective-1846842) , check out UltraFlix for free and paid 4K content.

 What We Don't Like

 If you spend much time on Facebook and love watching user-uploaded videos and live news feeds,[Facebook Watch](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-facebook-watch-4175805) may be the app to check out.

 Like YouTube and Instagram Video, Facebook Watch lets you watch user-generated videos on your big-screen Samsung TV. The videos are grouped into easy-to-navigate categories: Live Videos, Videos You've Shared, Videos Shared by Friends, Videos You've Uploaded, Videos from Pages You Follow, Facebook Watch Originals, and more. You can also watch a lot of live news feeds from sources such as the LA Times, Bloomberg, and ABC News, as well as live gaming and some live sports.

* Low cost if you can live with limited ads on a basic subscription.

 What We Don't Like

* Although cable subscription isn't required, you still have to pay a subscription fee via the app.
* Doesn't duplicate HBO's live cable feed.
* Need a premium subscription to view content ad-free.

 You don't need a cable or satellite subscription to get HBO. With a subscription to Max, you can enjoy all of the popular programs and movies offered by HBO on your Samsung Smart TV via the Internet. Here is your chance if you haven't seen_Game of Thrones_ or_Our Flag Means Death_ .

[Download Max](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fappstore%2Fapp%2FG16040006493)
