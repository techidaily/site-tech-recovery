###  What To Know

* Go to**System Settings** \>**Displays** \> hold down the**Option** key > click**Detect Displays** .
* Go to**System Settings** \>**Displays** and check the resolution and brightness settings.
* Also, check the display cable connections, and update adapter software if applicable.

 This article offers tips on the display settings and cable specifications to check to fix an issue with a Mac not detecting an external display.

##  How to Fix Mac Display Issues

 Try the following fixes, in order, to try to get your Mac to recognize the external display.

1. If you're using a MacBook, try plugging it into power. Some power-saving settings restrict certain processes to extend battery life.
2. Make sure your Mac supports more than one additional monitor. You can check the supported number of displays by clicking the**Apple** icon**System Settings** \>**Help** \>_your MacBook_ \> and looking under**Display Support** or**Video Support** .  
 On older macOS versions, click the**Apple** icon >**About This Mac** \>**Support** \>**Specifications** \>**Graphics and Video Support** .
3. Double-check your cables. The first thing you should do is make sure your cables are both correct and secure. Confirm that any cords running between your Mac and the display are firmly connected to both, and ensure that the display is plugged in.
4. If the cables seem fine, try unplugging them for a moment and then plugging them back in. Restarting the external display may give your Mac a fresh shot at recognizing it.
5. If you're using an adapter, make sure that your monitor and cable combo is compatible with your Mac. Some Macs use only[ USB-C](https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490) or both[ Thunderbolt](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713) and USB-C connections, while some Thunderbolt variations require a Thunderbolt-specific adapter.  
 In the case of a dock, check its manufacturer's support site and download new drivers, if applicable.
6. Check your resolution settings by going to**System Settings** \>**Displays** . Press and hold down the**Option** key. This combination will reveal a hidden**Detect Displays** option at the bottom right. Click this button so that your Mac can scan for a connected display.  
 On older macOS versions, get to this option by selecting**System Preferences** \>**Displays** \>**Scaled** .
7. Choose different resolutions. Still in**Resolution** settings,**Ctrl+click** a resolution on the list > and choose**Show Thumbnails** . Select a thumbnail other than the default option to see if this prompts a change.  
![Show Thumbnails for resolutions highlighted from Displays settings in macOS.](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/gTI3h4YmCyirugpxj5MD7Hh2a4Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/001_fix-external-display-not-detected-on-mac-5096070-ecca1b8f283649b0be34a215a5037d00.jpg)  
 You may see a radio button next to**Scaled** . If you do, choose a different resolution from this view.
8. Deselect automatic brightness adjustments. Under**Brightness** , uncheck the box next to or deselect**Automatically adjust brightness** and manually brighten using the toggle. If the external display's brightness is too low to register, this could resolve that issue.
9. Put your Mac to sleep for a moment, and then wake it back up to see if anything changes in the Display preferences.
10. Restart your Mac with the external display connected.
11. Finally, disconnect all of the cables, power off your Mac and the external monitor for a minute or two, and then reconnect the cables and turn everything back on. Repeat the steps in Display settings if the monitor still doesn't work.

 Increase your chances for success by avoiding daisy-chaining several adapters and cables together. Macs tend to work best with external displays when an Apple-branded or compatible cable and adapter are directly involved.

##  Why Isn't the Mac Recognizing the Display?

 Problems between Macs and external monitors can come from a variety of causes, including:

* Incompatibility between the Mac and the monitor.
* Faulty cables (or the wrong cables).
* Power-saving options in a MacBook preventing it from running an external monitor.
* Outdated drivers or software for docks.
* Incorrect settings in your Mac's Display settings, including brightness and resolution.
