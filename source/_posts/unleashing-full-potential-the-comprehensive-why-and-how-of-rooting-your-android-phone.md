You need to install [SetCPU](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhuang.overclocking&hl=en) app to overlock CPU which can increase prefessor's frequency to boost performance.

### 5\. Flash a Custom ROM

ROM means Read Only Memory. Flashing a custom ROM basically means to load a different version of the Android OS. Using a custom ROM usually results in more frequent updates that fix bugs and introduce new features. Custom ROMs are often times faster, more efficient, and use less memory. And you can upgrade to a version of the OS that has not yet been released for your device, or never will be.
