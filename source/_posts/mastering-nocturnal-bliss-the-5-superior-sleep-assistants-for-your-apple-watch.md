* Sleep Rings help you track your sleep goals visually.
* Analyzes your sleep quality, detailing time asleep, restlessness, and heart rate.

 What We Don't Like

* There's not a free version.
* Extensive functionality can be complex to figure out.

 AutoSleep helps you automatically track your sleep from an Apple Watch. It has two options, depending on if you like to sleep while wearing your watch. If you wear your watch to sleep, you don't have to do anything to trigger the sleep tracking. If you don't wear your watch to sleep, place it on the charger when you go to bed and put it back on your wrist when you get up. 

 The app includes Sleep Rings, which are similar to the Activity Rings on your watch. They help you visually track your sleep goals. The AutoSleep function will analyze your sleep quality, detailing your time asleep, restlessness, time awake, and heart rate to score your quality of sleep (assuming you wear your watch to bed).

 AutoSleep costs $5.99, and there are no additional subscriptions or hidden charges.
