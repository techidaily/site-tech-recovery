## Untangling the Mystery of a Lost Launch.dll File - Fix Steps Inside
 Launch.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the launch[DLL file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-dll-file-2625852) .  

 The launch.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's[operating systems](https://www.lifewire.com/operating-systems-2625912) , including[Windows 11](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-11-5188930) ,[Windows 10](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-10-2626217) ,[Windows 8](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-8-2626235) ,[Windows 7](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-7-2626265) ,[Windows Vista](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-vista-2626311) ,[Windows XP](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-xp-2626354) , and Windows 2000.

## How to Fix Launch.dll Errors

 Follow these steps in the order they're given below to try the simpler solutions first.  

 Do not download launch.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why[downloading a DLL file is a bad idea](https://www.lifewire.com/important-reasons-not-to-download-dll-files-2624455) . If you need a copy of launch.dll, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.

1. [Restore launch.dll from the Recycle Bin](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-deleted-files-from-the-recycle-bin-2624515) . The easiest possible cause of a "missing" launch.dll file is that you've mistakenly deleted it.  
 If you suspect this, but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to recover the file with a[free data recovery program](https://www.lifewire.com/free-data-recovery-software-tools-2622893) .  
[Start Windows in Safe Mode](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-start-windows-in-safe-mode-2624480) to complete this step, or any of the following steps, if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the error.
2. [Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system](https://www.lifewire.com/properly-scan-your-computer-for-viruses-and-other-malware-2624526) . Some launch.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the launch.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.
3. [Use System Restore to undo recent system changes](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-system-restore-in-windows-2626131) . If you suspect that the launch.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,[System Restore](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-system-restore-2626022) could solve the problem.
4. [Reinstall the program that uses the launch.dll file](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-the-proper-way-to-reinstall-a-software-program-2624478) . If the launch.dll DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling the program should replace the file.  
 Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the launch.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.
5. [Update the drivers for hardware devices](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-update-drivers-in-windows-2619214) that might be related to launch.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file launch.dll is missing" error when you play a 3D video game, try updating the[drivers](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-device-driver-2625796) for your[video card](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-video-card-2618161) .  
 The launch.dll file may or may not be related to video cardsâ€”this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.
6. [Roll back a driver to a previously installed version](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-2619217) if launch.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.
7. [Install any available Windows updates](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-check-for-install-windows-updates-2624596) . Many[service packs](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-service-pack-2626010) and other[patches](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-patch-2625960) replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The launch.dll file could be included in one of those updates.  
 It's important to update Windows even if the launch.dll file isn't one of the included updates. It's possible that an update you have yet to install is needed in order for launch.dll to function properly.
8. [Test your memory](https://www.lifewire.com/free-memory-test-programs-2626178) and then[test your hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183) . We've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's[memory](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-random-access-memory-ram-2618159) and[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause launch.dll errors as they fail.  
 If the hardware fails any of your tests,[replace the memory](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-the-memory-ram-in-a-computer-2626201) or[replace the hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-replace-a-hard-drive-2626200) as soon as possible.
9. [Repair your installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-i-automatically-repair-windows-problems-2624907) . If the individual launch.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.
10. [Use a free registry cleaner](https://www.lifewire.com/free-registry-cleaners-2626176) to repair launch.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing invalid launch.dll[registry entries](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-registry-key-2625999) that might be causing the DLL error.
11. [Perform a clean installation of Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-2624904) . This will erase everything from the[hard drive](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hard-disk-drive-2618152) and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the launch.dll error, this should be your next course of action.  
 All the information on your hard drive will be erased during this step. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the launch.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.
12. [Troubleshoot for a hardware problem](https://www.lifewire.com/fix-a-dll-issue-caused-by-a-hardware-problem-2624493) if any launch.dll errors persist. After a clean Windows installation, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.

## Causes of Launch.dll Errors

 In some cases, launch.dll errors could indicate a[registry](https://www.lifewire.com/windows-registry-2625992) problem, a virus or malware issue or even a[hardware](https://www.lifewire.com/computer-hardware-2625895) failure.

![launch DLL error message in Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/k_YGOlhyUKvrhvwM9_Xrb9X-W0E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/launch-dll-error-message-5ae763f8642dca0037f2c877.png)

 There are several ways launch.dll errors can show up on your computer. Here are some examples:

* **Launch.dll Not Found**
* **This application failed to start because launch.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.**
* **Cannot find \[PATH\]\\launch.dll**
* **The file launch.dll is missing.**
* **Cannot start \[APPLICATION\]. A required component is missing: launch.dll. Please install \[APPLICATION\] again.**

 The launch.dll file isn't the same as launcher.dll. However, launcher.dll errors might still look a lot like the errors listed above, and you should still be able to use the general troubleshooting steps you see below. Conversely, a message like "failed to launch .DLL" or "launch DLL error" could be referring to a different DLL file entirely.

 Launch.dll error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation. The context of the error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem.
