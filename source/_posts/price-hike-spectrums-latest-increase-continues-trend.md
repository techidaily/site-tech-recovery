## Price Hike: Spectrum's Latest Increase Continues Trend

Price hikes on cable and internet service are nothing new, but with the cost of other necessities and entertainment rising at the same time, they're even more annoying. Now, Spectrum is raising prices again for customers of its internet and cable packages.

 Spectrum, one of America's largest cable providers, has again raised its prices this July, marking the second price increase this year. If you're a Spectrum user, you can expect to see a $3 monthly increase on all [internet plans](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-junior-jams-and-junction-gaming/), with legacy plans facing a steeper $4 increase. Home phone plans and TV Select will also see a $3 bump in certain states. This news comes after Spectrum raised its low-income plan from $20 to $25 in January and increased router rental fees from $5 to $7\. A $3 price increase might not sound like much, but as we always point out whenever we report on any price increase on any kind of subscription, even a $1 difference can quickly add up if you pay for more than one subscription.

 The company has attributed the price hikes to rising costs, despite an earnings report revealing a loss of over 72,000 internet and 405,000 cable TV customers in the first quarter of 2024\. Spectrum is telling customers that it is working to keep prices low and offer products that best meet their needs, for whatever that's worth.

 If you're a Spectrum user and you don't necessarily feel like paying more money, you can always just call in and try to negotiate a better fee, although considering how the company recently laid off people in its call center, even this might prove more challenging than it used to be. It doesn't hurt to try, however, if you really can't afford it. Otherwise, you might just want to check a lower-priced plan.
