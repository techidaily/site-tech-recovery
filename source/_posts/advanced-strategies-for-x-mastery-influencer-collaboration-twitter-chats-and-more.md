## [Advanced Strategies for X Mastery: Influencer Collaboration, Twitter Chats, & More!]

Close 

 Are you new to[ X (formerly Twitter)](https://www.lifewire.com/what-exactly-is-twitter-2483331) ? The popular microblogging platform has been around for years now, but that doesn't mean you missed the boat. With a few essential X tips, you can be a pro tweeter in no time. Here's what you need to know.

##  Decide Whether You Want a Public or Private Profile 

 X is an open and public social network where anyone can see your posts and interact with you. By default, your profile is public. However,[ you can make your X activity private](https://www.lifewire.com/make-your-twitter-profile-private-3486093) so that only people who follow you (which requires your approval first) can interact with you.

##  Observe How Users Interact on X 

 Before you jump into tweeting, consider checking out other user profiles to see how they use X. You can learn a lot by observing other people's behavior and habits. Looking at how other people act on X gives you a good idea of what sort of X etiquette exists.

 Some of the things you can do right away to[ build your X following](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-get-followers-on-twitter-4628136) include:

* Scheduling tweets for maximum exposure.
* Adding visuals to your tweets.
* Tweeting more often.

## Learn How Retweets Work 

 Retweets are a huge part of X and often make certain pieces of content go viral. Retweeting is a way of sharing another user's tweet and is simple to do, but there are a few ways of doing it.

 You definitely want to figure out[ how X retweets work](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-retweet-on-twitter-3486593) and how automatic retweets differ from[ manual retweets](https://www.lifewire.com/manual-retweet-definition-3486086) . You should also take a look at[ quote retweets](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-quote-a-tweet-on-twitter-4685775) , which let you add comments to posts you share.

##  Understand How Hashtags Work 

[ Hashtags](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-hashtag-on-twitter-3486592) categorize tweets on X and make it easier for users to find posts according to a specific theme (marked by a hashtag). When you use hashtags correctly, you can attract new followers and interactions.

 You can find hashtags for new movies, political causes, news items, and more. Check out the Search tab on X to see what's trending in your area, nationally, or around the world.

##  Tweet When Your Followers Are Most Active 

 Depending on who your X followers are and where they're located in the world, your best tweets may not be visible if you post at a time when your followers aren't paying attention to their feeds.

 You may want to experiment with[ tweeting at different times](https://www.lifewire.com/best-time-of-day-to-tweet-3486090) throughout the day to see what results in the most interaction.

##  Use X From Your Mobile Device 

 X is great to use from the regular web, but it really shines from a phone or tablet. You can take your mobile device with you and tweet about what you're doing or whatever thoughts pop up at the moment.

 If you're not impressed with the X mobile app or want to see what else is out there, you have other options. There are plenty of[ third-party X clients](https://www.lifewire.com/best-mobile-twitter-apps-3486098) available that you might like more.

##  Post Photos to Make Your Tweets More Visually Appealing 

 Tweets with photos attached receive more engagement from followers. That's because these tweets are hard to miss in people's feeds. They grab attention right away.[ Tweeting a GIF](https://www.lifewire.com/share-a-gif-on-twitter-3984263) , photo, or image is especially visible on mobile platforms.

 Select the image icon in the tweet composer to add up to four photos.

##  Get More Involved With Conversations by Joining an X Chat 

 X can feel lonely if you're only connected to users who tweet once in a while. Joining an X chat or two can be a great way to:

* Interact with other like-minded users in real time.
* Find more users to follow.
* Attract more followers.
* Expand your network.

##  Automatically Tweet Your Newest Blog Posts 

 If you have a blog, use a tool to automatically tweet new posts when you publish a new blog post. This saves you the time and energy of doing it manually. Use[ IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to link your blog to your X account and send new posts to your followers automatically.

##  Use Social Media Management Tools to Schedule and Automate Your Tweets 

 Speaking of X automation, there are all sorts of[ third-party social media management tools](https://www.lifewire.com/social-media-apps-for-managing-everything-3486302) that connect to your X account and allow you to manage it more effectively.
