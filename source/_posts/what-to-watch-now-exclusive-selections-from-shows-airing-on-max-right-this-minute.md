_Titans_ manages to offer a fresh take on a classic franchise. All the stars of_Teen Titans_ , led by Robin (Brenton Thwaites), are a little older and a lot grittier. This superhero show isn't for kids.

 The episodic format makes_Titans_ much easier to digest than the four-hour director's cut of_Justice League_ . If you like this series, be sure to check out_Doom Patrol_ on Max, which takes place in the same universe and features many of the same actors.
