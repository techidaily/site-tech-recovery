## Top Smartphone Savings: Unlocking the Most Amazing Offers in March 2024  Insights

If you're shopping for a new phone, there are plenty of great options on the market right now, both on iOS and Android. And the best part is how many of those devices, which we've tested and reviewed and ZDNET, are often on sale, selling for hundreds of dollars less than retail.

Below I've broken down the best offers on the most competent smartphones. Our most-recommended deals include the Samsung Galaxy S24 promotions offered by [AT&T](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/browse/samsung/) and [Verizon](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra/). Both AT&T and Verizon will give you up to $1,000 off one of the new devices with an eligible trade-in and 5G plan. For more deals, including ones for the iPhone 15 series and Google Pixel 8, see the full list below.

## The best smartphone deals

[Google Pixel 8 Save $300](https://mint-mobile.58dp.net/c/159047/444520/7915?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdevices%2Fgoogle-pixel-8%2F4367987%2F%3F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)

The Google Pixel 8 was ZDNET's sleeper pick for best Android device in 2023, and it still holds up this year. Right now, Mint Mobile is listing the Pixel phone for just $399, a $300 discount from its standard price. That includes six months of free wireless service when you pay for a six-month plan. One other thing to note with the deal is that the phone is only available in Obsidian and 128GB of storage.

[OnePlus 10T 5G Save $350](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-oneplus-10t-5g?)

While it's no longer the latest and greatest, the OnePlus 10T is one of the snappiest phones you can buy for the money thanks to the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, 120Hz AMOLED display, and software that's optimized for graphics-intensive tasks. It helps that the phone supports 80W wired charging, meaning it can go from 0 to 100% battery in less than 30 minutes.

Right now, Woot is selling the OnePlus 10T in new condition for $299 ($350 off), making it an ideal pick-up for Amazon Prime users who want a phone that charges fast and just works.

[Samsung Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus Save $1,300](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24plus.html)

* **Current price: Free**

Right now, AT&T is promoting an "On Us" offer for the new Samsung Galaxy S24 series. The promo, which gives you one of the latest phone models and a Galaxy Watch 6 at no cost, requires you to enroll in a 36-month installment plan, trade in an eligible smartphone (including any Galaxy Z, S, or Note series phone in any condition), and activate or keep a postpaid unlimited wireless service.

There are several prerequisites here, but they add up to $1,300 in savings, which, for someone who's looking to switch carriers or re-sign a contract, is very ideal.

The OnePlus Open currently sits at the top of ZDNET's best foldable phones list, and for good reason. The device is power-packed with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, the latest Qualcomm processor, and some of the fastest wired charging we've tested.

Motorola's Razr revamp last year was easily the best-value foldable phone on the market. While it's only been months since launch, the Razr is more accessibly priced than ever, with the company listing the 6.8-inch model for just $499 ($200 off). The Razr comes with a stylish faux leather backing, a handy external display, and a pocketable figure that's great for even smaller pockets.

## How did we choose these phone deals?

When we made our selection for the best phone deals available online, we included options based on the following criteria: 

* **Value:** The deal had to offer good value for money, especially regarding trade-in offers or discounts for new handsets, tablets, or entertainment products.
* **Affordability**: The economy is facing an uncertain time, and when we experience this type of disruption, it is sometimes essential to reduce our expenses as much as possible. With this in mind, we have included products suitable for various budgets.
* **Variety:** We require various smartphones to suit different users and their needs.
* **Free products**: Devices drop in value over time, and to offload excess stock, some carriers will launch time-sensitive deals, giving subscribers free products in exchange for signing up for a new contract.
* **Events**: It's always worth checking retailers after a significant event, such as Apple's annual event. You will often find that deals will be launched just after, luring customers to agree to preorder their new handset in return for discounts and free storage upgrades.
